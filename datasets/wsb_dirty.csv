21,wallstreetbets,"Amazing, just post about sound investing strategy &amp; Karma takes another hit. Warped reality of Redditt. This bull market long, very profitable. Real world economy don't care about WSB or Robinhood investor How many of these anonymous accounts shilling GME AMC are controlled by big, licensed brokers?","How many of these anonymous accounts are controlled by big brokerage firms, not small Robinhood guys? No way to tell, so I suspect the worst, knowing these fucks!

Worked for shady brokers in 1998, cold calling from insurance company lists. Hollywood depiction of sick, twisted brokers, nowhere as bad as real thing. That three months was education in how fucked up people are.

We made 200 phone calls a day, and everyone is a liar. Rich dudes say they're broke, while the janitor who picks up phone call intended for his boss, says he's loaded, and an active investor. Nicest people live in Wisconsin. They actually apologize before they hang up. Worst are in all the usual places. Don't even bother to call NJ.

The brokers were straight up thug life. Nothing like Michael Douglas in Wall Street. Fistfights broke out all the time. The older trainees would try to mess up my calls, by saying ""sales call"" so loud, the client could hear, and would hang up.

One desperate guy was eavesdropping on another guy's call and tried to front-run his order. He took a half done order to window, when the other guy ran up and started to beat the crap out of him. The way they tore at each other's flesh, like two rabid animals.

Casual Fridays featured a cup, passed around for everyone to put in something disgusting. At end of day, they bid up the prize for whoever would drink it. First, just old coffee, spit, ashes. Finally fingernail clippings, boogers, toe cheese.. They bid it up to $1k. Looked at that pile of cash and considered it.

The sight of the poor bastard who did it, so desperate for the money, made me realize that was me now. I quit next Monday, with a wealth of knowledge. If not the series 7 license they promised me, if I stayed. The firm was closed a few years later. All the principles had already been banned by SEC. They were operating under suckers, who let them use their licenses.

We didn't have Redditt for pump and dump... Now, it's so easy. WSB largest boiler room in history.",1642194269

Company is fine, personally wouldn’t buy their shoes or shirts etc. except their Fußballtrikots, but they are on a good way nevertheless (it’s also in the german DAX). So if my computations are right (and I haven’t made any) the stock will go up again on Tuesday and in the next weeks to 110€ at least, why now is the time you should or could take the chance of a short investment. I’ll have a try so good luck and have a entspanntes Wochenende ☀️ (and of course go long on GIVI€ is better but with this opportunity now you can make some asset to put it afterwards back in GIVI€ 🤷‍♂️)",1642194000

63,wallstreetbets,Studying the Popular Mind (aka you people),"I recently read some books on the madness of crowds, and I want to share some of the observations here.

One observation noted in most of the books is that as individuals we possess critical thinking, have a rigid moral code, and are masculine when we can be (this applies to females too, these books are from the 1800's when women were thought to have the mental capacity of a child). 

When we are in a group this changes. We become more emotional and driven towards simple images or ideas that don't need much explanation (aka any actual DD on GME or AMC). We see a mission and want to participate in it with the fury of a crusader. 

We also look for angry voices to guide us, as hatred (of established investment firms) is stronger than any love. We see those crying for fairness as weak and those presenting themselves as aggressive leaders we see as strong. 

We see this mission of taking on Wall Street as noble, but will future generations? or will we even see it as such in 20-30 years? In the time of many people who were alive pre- and post-Napoleon he was seen as a saviour, dictator, tyrant, and hero again. How will we perceive what we have done here on an individual level when we are much older? Will we agree with the mad crowds we support now, or will we see this as a pointless exercise that, for the vast majority of those who invested, bore no fruit? 

I really want to hear what you folks have to say about this because it will help all of us understand each other a bit better.

- stock near ATH
- extended PE around 36
- stock rallied past month cause analyists pushed it hard
-earnings on tuesday
- was a Covid winner
- Q4 21 probably wasn't as good for brokers as the Qs before
- guidance for brokers shouldn't be all shinny for a broker in 2022
-I think in this market earnings have to beat bold in all points for a stock near ATH to go higher

127,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates and you - a macro analysis, from someone who doesn't understand macro, written for an audience that doesn't understand anything"," Why you should listen to me : Like most of you, I’ve been contemplating the macroeconomic implications of our current interest rate environment. And, hopefully like most of you, I’ve come to realize that I have no idea what I’m talking about

I’ll try to use lots of pictures. We’re currently in the most interest rate negative environment we’ve had in awhile

&amp;#x200B;

Negative interest rates are funny, you know when you use forbidden corn and you get paid to take out a loan everyone wants to call it a ponzi, but in traditional finance we just call it rich people collateralizing their assets to take out loans against them

to defer tax payments as long as possible (banks then use these collateralized assets to lend to anyone wanting leverage or to borrow for a short, just like in forbidden corn land).

Anyways when we’re talking about interest rates it’s important to remember that money has a time element attached to it. In general the lower the interest rate, the more valuable money farther out in time is. To calculate this, we use discounted cash flow (I promise this is the only time I’ll utter these words), check out this table

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ly22r4g9pb81.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2002493603957f0ec08d25b3b3b9cf50f4e6ce14

 You can see that if your business is going to generate 5500 in the next 5 years, if interest rates are positive you would prefer to have that cash up front, but if interest rates are negative the most profitable is for you to get all of that money at the end

For markets what matters is the rate of change these things are moving in (so like, first derivative) which begs the question

Why the fuck is everyone selling ARK growth stonks when the rate of change of interest rate environment has been increasingly more and more negative ?

I honestly think people are putting themselves off sides here and that the ARK trade is going to reverse soon as it dawns on people that 1) we’re going to be in a negative real rate environment for awhile 2) that everyone is way way way offsides

How do we play this ?

What follows is generally complete nonsense and probably wrong for a bunch of reasons, but I had to figure out which ARK calls I want to buy so here we go

So I’ve been selling puts on GME for months fairly profitably, up until maybe the last 2 months when I have been getting completely ran over and forced to take delivery every single time I sell a put on a dip. Anecdotally, I know call sellers who bought into GME at 15 and who have similarly been making money selling calls against shares for months. This dynamic can lead to volatility suppression at some points in the volatility surface which theoretically mean some calls should be good “value”.

I imagine some people who hold individual ARK names that are deep in profit are similarly selling calls, or if they are particularly bullish on a single name selling puts etc = vol cheap on the front end, so buy it

Here’s a chart with different tickers, strikes, and IV calculated from ETRADE for 1,2,3,4 week tenors. Note all our brokers calculate IV poorly so this chart is literally crime but tbh I just wanna throw darts so who gives a fuck give it a look and pick ur poison

&gt; Empathy His father, Cohen said, never considered himself better than the employees who unloaded his trucks, or anyone who worked for him. When a truck would arrive at the warehouse, his father would take off his suit jacket and unload the pallets with the warehouse crew... “He put himself at the same level as people doing the hardest work,” Cohen said. “That’s where I learned empathy, that’s where I learned humility,” two important traits in a startup entrepreneur when they are trying to convince others to join them in a new company, he said. - [Forbes - January 26th, 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/)

RC’s setting a great example and inspiring many others persevere through an unusual time 🤜🏼🤛🏼

## Preface

And while I’m sure the decision for board placement was decided well in advance, it’s coincidental that a second noteworthy event occurred on January 11th, 2020 which seems to have been a quiet catalyst preceding the January price increase and subsequent trading halt - the CDS Determination Committee’s publishing of the Europcar Mobility Group CDS auction terms.  The auction, which occurred on January 13th, 2021, was ultimately characterized as a “[classic short squeeze](https://ft.com/content/69accf15-1ab7-426b-aadc-6f594d24dd65)” and had [butterfly effect](https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1400474857733705728?s=21)-type implications that’ve only been further corroborated by significant real-world events of the past few months.

These implications support claims Retail Investors were inaccurately portrayed as the antagonists responsible for stock market volatility throughout 2021 which this post will be addressing through a broad, wide-ranging explanation of fortunate/unfortunate events that help contextualize what’s unfolded with GameStop to date and might be expected from a high level moving forward.

Key topics of discussion:
1. Archegos, Ark Invest, SoftBank and Greensill
2. Europcar Mobility Group, IHS Markit and Creditex
3. Caveat Emptor, Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11, Trade Credit and Trade Credit Insurance

## Background

### March 6th, 2020
Archegos reports “long-bias” of 72.35% - an increase of 21.67% since their previous report on February 7th, 2020 
- The family office’s *long* positions (expecting shares to rise) were disproportionate relative to their *short* positions (expecting shares to fall) which was, perhaps un-intuitively, very risky (given the portfolio’s deviation from delta neutrality)
- Having a long bias of this nature increases risk exposure due to the simple fact that if you have fewer short positions the odds one of those positions might succeed rather than fail (as a business) increases 
- Archegos’ long bias fluctuated between 63% and 95% long for nearly every week until its default

### March 18th, 2020
ARKK closes at $34.69, which would end up being it’s 2020 low and $89.80 less than their year-end close of $124.49 - a 258.86% increase
- The timing of Ark Invest’s ascent started around the same when Archegos began breaching their Potential Exposure (PE) limit
- It was later revealed that Archegos originally seeded Ark’s first four ETFs in 2013

### May 13th, 2020
“CLOs and the loans underpinning them are ground zero in terms of the vulnerability of this crisis,” says Matthew Mish, a credit analyst at UBS.
- The loans underpinning CLOs are called Loan-only Credit Default Swaps (LCDS)
- An IHS Markit index called the LCDX, which was specifically created by banks in 2007 ahead of the financial crisis to profit from it, actually stopped trading during October 2020 due to low liquidity (which also happened during 2008)
- 2020 saw highest number of credit default events since 2009

### August 20th, 2020
Greensill scrutiny ramps up and Credit Suisse begins removing once-public materials related to Greensill from their website
- SoftBank invested $500 million in “technology bets” on June 24th, 2020 only to pull the investment roughly two months later after an internal review by Credit Suisse
- Credit Suisse was marketing the funds to institutional investors and corporations as a safe place to invest their cash in short-term debts they said were in “diversified companies”
- Clients withdrew $1.5bn from Greensill’s funds between January 1st and June 24th, 2020

### September 1st, 2020
Tokio Marine notifies Greensill Capital they will not be renewing the $10bil Credit Suisse policy taken out for the purpose of syndicating Greensill’s loans
- The risk profile of Greensill’s loans increased when they lost their syndication because financial instruments like CLOs rely on the  loans being syndicated for investment suitability purposes
- This is the reason why I believe the Fed’s ACH payment service Fedwire had an operational outage on February 24th, 2021 - when the underlying credit was formally frozen and Greensill was unable to transfer money to their debtors 🐸🍦

“While staff did find GME options trading volume from individual
customers increased substantially, from only $58.5 million on January 21 to $563.4 million on January 22 until peaking at $2.4 billion on January 27, this increase in options trading volume was mostly driven by an increase in the buying of put, rather than call, options. **Further, data show that market-makers were buying, rather than writing, call options. These observations by themselves are not consistent with a gamma squeeze.**”
- Robert Rasamny taking over as CCO of Melvin Capital ahead of the buy button being disabled is evidence that points to Gary Cohn’s SPAC as having quietly acquired Melvin and their liabilities

- And one day before Greensill being frozen
- GME begins rising on this day for 2nd time after “sneeze”
- Reports Credit Suisse could be impacted by DOJ scrutiny of DPA breaches (supposedly “common” in libor rigging)

## Hypothesis

This is getting long so let me cut to the chase - what we’ve been witnessing is the breakdown of a [securitization](https://images.app.goo.gl/fUbNBn1PMWbG14Gg8) process. 

The breakdown began during the first quarter of 2020 when CLO managers pulled their money from Greensill after realizing the pandemic would bankrupt many companies.  This created an arbitrage opportunity for Archegos who  invested in the LCDX basket (through Greensill notes) hoping to *make* money off companies going bankrupt.  Archegos extracted incredible leverage from these concentrated short positions and then re-invested the capital in Ark Invest’s portfolio alongside SoftBank.

What these investment decisions ultimately resulted in was a historical setup to keen observers like Anchorage, King Street and Jefferies Group who knew if any one of the companies in the LCDX basket succeeded then whomever was being propped up by leverage from concentrated shorts would be negatively impacted (Ark Invest’s portfolio).  

When Europcar squeezed on January 13th, 2021 it not only demonstrated the  vulnerability of Loan-only Credit Default Swaps (LCDS) to restructuring but also signaled to those naked shorting the LCDX basket that they would need to find creative ways to buy back shares they would most likely never receive during bankruptcy auctions - this is what leads me to believe the January “sneeze” was an event manufactured by SPAC bag holders like Gary Cohn, Securities Lenders  like Steve Cohen, Market Makers like Ken Griffin and former Clearinghouse chairman Jeffrey Sprecher.  ***Why else would they purchase short-dated call options ahead of the buy button being disabled?***.  Even Elon Musk, who many thought was supporting GME while tweeting at the end of January, seems to have actually just been playing a role in the massive *Robinhood Rug Pull* knowing his company could be one of the most adversely impacted by the rise of GameStop.

The DTCC fallout from the Europcar auction (and “meme stock” margin calls) seems to have also enveloped Anchorage Capital whose Q2 filings showed surprise puts in GME ahead of their removal from the NSCC.  Check out these rules straight from the NSCC handbook:

&gt; “Each Member shall be obligated to the Corporation for the entire amount of any loss or liability incurred by the Corporation arising out of or relating to any Defaulting Member Event with respect to such Member. To the extent that such loss or liability is not satisfied pursuant to Section 3 of this Rule 4, the Corporation shall apply a Corporate Contribution thereto and charge the remaining amount of such loss or liability ratably to other Members, as further provided below.” - [DTCC](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf)

While essentially all facets of finance appear to have been involved in this breakdown there are two practices in particular that appear to have been at the very top of the funnel:
- Trade Credit (Hedge fund practice of firms like Eddie Lampert’s ESL Investments who deal in Capital Structure Arbitrage)
- Trade Credit Insurance (This is the role that Greensill was purporting to play while issuing Credit-linked Notes through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs))

If you’re dealing in *Trade Credit* (essentially white collar payday loans) it makes sense that you’d also purchase *Trade Credit Insurance*.  And if you were a Trade Creditor and your Trade Credit Insurer collapsed it also makes sense that a trading pattern would arise following the typical 30, 60, 90 and 120 day repayment schedules associated with Trade Credit policies.

**Go look at the GME chart and count out these (30, 60, 90, and 120 day) increments of time from January 21st, 2021 onward.**

Further evidence of GME having been impacted by Trade Credit can be observed in one of Ryan Cohen’s [tweets](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1400492465442811904?s=21).  Remember the 💀 next to the picture of Sears?  Turns out the OTC Markets website uses a skull and crossbones icon to denote “Caveat Emptor” (“buyer beware”) stocks like Sears (SHLDQ).  These are the same stocks that recently became limited to liquidation trades only due to Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11 [amendments](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-212).  Remember the recently departed SEC commissioners?  They were in opposition to these amendments [specifically](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-roisman-falling-further-back-121321).

The SEC has now moved on new regulations for SPACs, Swaps, Securities Lending and the Fed is now administering the LIBOR-replacement benchmark interest rate SOFR instead of Jeffrey Sprecher’s Intercontinental Exchange - the company he started started in 2000 and just [stepped down](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/nyse-shakes-up-leadership-as-president-cunningham-steps-down) as chair of on December 6th, 2021.  Can’t wait to hear what the DOJ has to say. 

## Conclusion

As of [April 23rd, 2021](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ubs-takes-surprise-774-million-archegos-hit-11619501547) Credit Suisse and Nomura reported still having 3% exposure to Archegos.  Given Archegos’ usage of 2-year non-cancelable bullet swaps I have no reason to believe either bank has closed their short positions and am very interested in seeing what happens over the next few weeks (expiration of bullet swaps?!).

The beauty of this thing is even if no MOASS, and the naked exposure cultivated by Archegos has been sufficiently hedged, GameStop is now debt free with best-in-class talent, leadership and undeniably massive market opportunities ahead of it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Visa is developing digital currencies for central banks around the world and will allow the currency to be used anywhere Visa is accepted (ie. everywhere).

&amp;#x200B;

Thats not the interesting part. The interesting part is considering how they will get the US (and other places) to adopt a digital currency. Current syrup is taxed as an asset and a straight up headache for traders, miners, and investors. I think that to incentivize adoption of a national syrup currency, the IRS will bend the rules that allow CBDC's to be treated 'as-cash' for accounting and tax reasons, while maintaining that other syrup is still to be treated as an ""asset"", which includes USDT. Obviously people will keep using and trading regular syrup, but the tax crackdowns will get worse and worse to disincentivize this. Visa will make insane profits by controlling national currency tech, and then will use those profits to lobby non-CBDC syrup laws.

The W.H.O. had a goal of vaccinating 40% percent of the population in every country by YE 2021 and they did not hit the goal.  The new goal is 70% of population in every country by mid 2022.  The lowest rates of vaccination are in the developing world where NVAX will have much greater uptake because it can use traditional cold chain storage.  In the developing world we are looking at a annual shot or booster.  The gross still to be vaccinated are kids (data suggests kids have less reactions to NVAX) and some anti-vax types may convert with a non-mRna - traditional protein based vaccine.  **The addressable market is every person on earth.  COVID is here to stay and it will be an arms race between vaccine manufacturers and the Virus Variants.**  NVAX will start leading that battle and we should get behind them.  (Disclaimer - Despite getting crushed yesterday.  I am all in on NVAX $240K in stock and Feb, Mar and April call options today worth $210k total today).  The only real risk is if they run into manufacturing or quality issues. They have had some time to address these so I think it is safe to believe the will really ramp up and deliver.

So one of the big warning signs of a massive crash is a string of hindenburg omen, we had it right prior to the crash in Feb/March of 2020. Again, this is not the a definitive warning, as it has given many false positives such as in March 2021, and Nov 2020 Aug 2020, and May 2020. But there is more. 

https://preview.redd.it/ad5qq4x6sob81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07098e28cc6c5944d7dde719b2d959e29001dd9e

Another thing to look at is breath of the market. We know that the breadth of the market is horrible, with something like 40% of NASDAQ down 50% for 20221. The entire stock market is held up by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook. The only times breadth was this terrible  was in 2000, Nov 2018, Feb 2020 and now in Jan 2022. 

https://preview.redd.it/xs6q6t8ptob81.png?width=1112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cefe6ce2eb7e5d86f3b03fb7c6771756706181bb

The final nail in the coffin is the VIX. In Feb 2020, you had a falling wedge in the VIX followed by a breakout before spiking to close to 80 in March. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uf9wu82ouob81.png?width=2439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6569ba7c5cbeab5a8a138a75d329097cb67aaad

A similar setup is happening today. Then there is the narrative, the market kept ignoring Covid which was baffling institutional investors going into Feb 2020, despite the rapid spread and the original variant having something like a 2-3% mortality rate. The same thing is happening today. The Fed signaled it was going to end QE and hike rates, but the market largely shrugged it off for a full month. Meanwhile China, the second largest economy where 1/3 of GDP is dependent on housing construction is rolling over and Russia is trying to invade Ukraine (which will send oil to $100+). Investors are ignoring all of this information. 

https://preview.redd.it/mqs98vnxuob81.png?width=2448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6b43b410c4a24e255a92c0f82fe2b538f241dfe

All of this is pointing towards a massive crash in the next couple of months. but you may counter, the fed won't let markets crash. If it tanks 10%, the fed will cave and give up on rate hikes and will start QE again and pump this market up like its 2020 again. The problem with this argument is that it makes a large assumption that the rise in stock market shares are driven by the fed, when there is a strong argument that it is in fact driven by the rise of passive investing (look into Mike Green if you want more analysis) on this and as a result is resembling a fractal that goes up in an exponential manner, with crazy deep flash crashes in between. This means it could suddenly crash 50% in 2 weeks and there would be nothing to stop it, because it is possible fed QE just creates bank reserves (which does nothing) and the only role the fed plays is in confidence in the market, and it can easily be destroyed like in March 2020, when the market crashed 15%, the fed then dropped rates to 0% and the market proceeded to crash more.

&amp;#x200B;

MOJAVE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virgin Orbit (Nasdaq: VORB), the responsive launch and space solutions company, confirmed it successfully deployed into orbit all 7 customer satellites onboard its LauncherOne rocket during today’s *Above the Clouds* mission.

Virgin Orbit’s 747 carrier aircraft Cosmic Girl took off from Mojave Air and Space Port this afternoon at approximately 1:39 PM PST/09:39 PM UTC and flew to a launch site over the Pacific Ocean, about 50 miles south of the Channel Islands. After a smooth release from the aircraft, the LauncherOne rocket ignited and propelled itself towards space, ultimately deploying its payload into a precise target orbit approximately 500km above the Earth’s surface at 45 degrees inclination. This is the first time that anyone has reached this orbit from the West Coast.

The launch was the company’s third successful flight, occurring less than one year from its first mission. Virgin Orbit has now successfully delivered commercial, government, international, and national security satellites to space, including new *Above the Clouds* customer Spire Global, Inc. (NYSE: SPIR), and first ever repeat customers: the U.S. Department of Defense Space Test Program and Polish company SatRevolution. This launch was awarded to Virgin Orbit through its subsidiary VOX Space by the DoD’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) as part of the DoD Space Test Program’s (STP) Rapid Agile Launch (RALI) Initiative.

The satellites launched on the company’s latest mission include experiments in space-based communications, space debris detection, and in-space navigation and propulsion, as well as satellites that will serve the global agricultural sector. The launch brings the total number of satellites launched by Virgin Orbit to 26.

Because of the unique air-launch system Virgin Orbit has developed, the *Above the Clouds* mission was launched in an orbit never before directly accessible from the West Coast of the Americas. Rather than launching from a fixed pad on the ground, Virgin Orbitconducts its launches from under the wing of a modified 747 aircraft, and by flying the aircraft further out over the ocean, the company was able to launch on a trajectory no ground-launch rocket could have achieved. That direct injection into the target orbit saved the satellites onboard this mission months of time and kilograms of fuel they might have otherwise spent correcting their orbit from what a landlocked launch site could provide them.

“Our customers are starting to hear back from their satellites that are checking in from orbit --- and for us, that’s what success looks like. It’s a thrill for our team that this mission included our first repeat customers as well as our first ‘last minute ticket’ customers and reached an orbit that no one had ever reached from the West Coastbefore, all of which confirms the team’s ability to provide top tier launch service anywhere, anytime,” said Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. “On top of that, we flew through weather and a cloud layer that would have grounded any other launch I’ve worked on in my career, something only made possible by air-launch and our incredible team. We can say with confidence that in this new era of regular, frequent, successful missions, we can help our customers and partners use space technology to advance human knowledge and open space for good.”

“This accomplishment today really shows the future of space launch capabilities, something that is of paramount importance to national security,” said VOX Space President Mark Baird, a retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General. “We have the ability to launch anywhere, anytime and unwarned, which allows us to customize the launches to serve a government’s mission and goals, allowing us to be better mission partners in their space operations.”

“What an unforgettable experience to watch the Virgin Orbit team complete another perfect mission to space. I could not be prouder of the work they are doing. I am beaming alongside them,” said Virgin Orbit founder Richard Branson. “We supported experimental, important work for our three happy customers today. I congratulate them and our wonderful team.”

*Above the Clouds* is named after the fifth track on Gang Starr’s 1998 album *Moment of Truth*, featuring Inspectah Deck of Wu-Tang Clan. The record was released by Virgin Records in collaboration with Noo Trybe Records and is widely regarded as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.

**ABOUT** **VIRGIN ORBIT**

Virgin Orbit (Nasdaq: VORB) operates one of the most flexible and responsive space launch systems ever built. Founded by Sir Richard Branson in 2017, the company began commercial service in 2021, and has already delivered commercial, civil, national security, and international satellites into orbit. Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne rockets are designed and manufactured in Long Beach, California, and are air-launched from a modified 747- 400 carrier aircraft that allows Virgin Orbit to operate from locations all over the world in order to best serve each customer’s needs.

238,wallstreetbets,$DCFC New ticker today for Tritium Charging. Very interesting situation playing out with the warrants today.,"As a result of Post-Closing financing the exercise price has been lowered from $11.50 to $6.90. With a very small PIPE here of only 1.5mm shares and solely owned by $PLTR this one will not have as much selling pressure that has plagued many recent deSPACs. The company is also growing at an incredible rate with nearly $80mm in 2021 revenue and $170mm projected for 2022. This is quite high relative to other EV Chargers. News flow has been very strong here as well with many new partnerships announced. Current partners include Shell, Blink, Nikola, Chargepoint, Osprey, among many more. 

This deSPAC is well worth the further DD. The warrants at current levels also present a compelling upside thesis with the exercise price now lowered to $6.90. Below warrant information from todays 6-K.

Before I get into that, I need you all to know that I don’t give a shit about whatever wack political or scientific (often the opposite of deduction by means of the scientific method) bullshit you believe. 

Okay - so back to the pattern I observed. Firstly, 5 days for quarantine now? This was the “deadliest virus in human history,” according to some of those previously mentioned “experts.” Sounds more like they realized that this new variant isn’t that bad and herd immunity is the way to go at this point, so they are trying to make that a thing without admission of being right or wrong (probably wrong…) with guidance in the past. 

Secondly, vaccine mandates have just been ruled unconstitutional in the private sector. So all those airlines and travel companies who fought it from the beginning didn’t have to fire those who didn’t conform. What does this mean for them? It means they still have the ability to operate at full capacity and even at an accelerated rate. 

This brings me to my final point. The travel/vacation industry is ready to explode (especially with spring around the corner). I’m not here to tell you which stock to buy… just that you all should take a good look into these companies and get in now.

That is all…",1642173977
318,wallstreetbets,Why the Cannabis Sector is overvalued and Companies are doomed to fail.,"This is my first Post of this Sort and it is supposed to trigger a constructive discussion of the Sector as a whole aswell as individual Companies, thats why i chose the provoking Title. I wrote this Post as a Contrast to the echo Chamber, which the Sub has become instead of actually having an discussion. If you don’t like or agree to the things i have to say please disagree or correct me in the Comments but be constructive about it. Im open to criticism. 

Lets first address the Makro economic difficulties, which the sector has to face.

Legalization in some Countries might  be further away as people expect and definitely certain Companies expect. For example the german government recently agreed to legalize Cannabis in their coalition contract and i already saw people on this sub hyping it up and saying that Company XYZ will moon because of this. The problem is that Germany is a very bureaucratic country and new Law drafts take time. A „legalization“ like the one currently in place in the Netherlands, which relys on grey zones in the law to function will not be applicable for Germany. Also historically speaking a lot of promises in the coalition contract are not actually implemented and the current one is more ambitious than ever. Stating that the Tax rates will not be increased aswell as a lot of Government Subsidies towards Ev; digitalization; etc the contrast to this that they actually want to reduce National Debt. These are two Contrasts, which can’t easily be achieved.

Some Countries haven’t even considered legalizing marijuana even if the pressure from around the world rises.

All of this will later be important when we talk about the production and sector as a whole so keep it in mind.

The negative sites of Cannabis.

Most people ever talk only about the positive aspects of cannabis consumption and leave out the negatives. With Arguments like „Alkohol kills people weed doesn’t“ any criticism will directly be disregarded. I will not elaborate on this further because i want to focus on the sector as a whole not cannabis as a product.

This next sector will focus on Canada as an example but its applicable to most other countries where weed is legal.

High Supply - Low demand 

Canada alone has 776 Producers of Marijuana, which invest heavily in scaling up production, which might be bad idea because the demand does not cope with the supply.

2 of the top Marijuana Companies have an annual production so high that it can satisfy 70% of Canadas Consumption.

80% of produced Cannabis is not being sold and is wasted.

https://imgur.com/a/ZOCvN92

The quality of product will rise across the board so the main point of selling will be the price. The cannabis industry is already full of competition. Experts say that by 2024 the price of cannabis might sink to as low as 5$ per gram or even further.

This high supply in combination with the commoditization will lead to sinking prices and thus will lead to tumbling profit margins.

Many people might argue that demand will rise as soon as other countries legalize. The first thing we touched upon earlier is that legalization might be further out than some people expect. Second of all these Countries will have Marijuana producers themselves and thus contribute to an already oversaturated market and then again the transport cost of foreign cannabis will even further decrease the profiting margins. 

Most Marijuana companies have yet to turn a profit and are losing money annually. If you factor in the future Market evolution some companies might go under and those who do prosper might not even be founded yet. The operational risk of these companies is very high.

Valuation
The valuation of marijuana companies is insane even if the fell rapidly over the last year. Some even trading at 10-30x Sales ratio. Even leaving out Earnings ratio just because most of them dont earn a dime. This valuation obviously priced in future growth of the sector as a whole which like already discussed might be slower than anticipated.",1642173931

373,wallstreetbets,The listing is close to another big move? LG Energy is rumored to establish a battery joint venture with Honda in the United States,"According to the South Korean media Maeil Business Newspaper, South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution (LGES) is in discussions with Japan's Honda Motor Co. to establish a battery joint venture in the United States.

LGES plans to start trading on the Korean exchange on Jan. 27 and is expected to raise nearly $11 billion, making it the largest IPO ever in South Korea, LG Group Vice Chairman and LGES CEO Kwon Young-soo said at a bookkeeping meeting on Monday, adding that the company will soon announce a joint venture with a car company.

Sources said the LGES-Honda battery joint venture could involve an investment of up to 4 trillion won ($3.4 billion) and a plant capacity of up to 40 gigawatt hours (GWh) to power 600,000 high-performance electric vehicles. However, details of the exact timeline, location and capacity have not yet been decided.

**A rare alliance**

If true, it would be a rare case of a Japanese-Korean company alliance. The current bilateral relationship between Japan and South Korea is still deteriorating over some historical issues, and the proposed partnership with Honda is surprising given the closed nature of Japanese companies.

But the deal is not without merit. One of the more obvious reasons is that the joint venture's plants are reportedly ready to support new Honda vehicles made in the U.S. starting in 2024, while the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will come into effect in 2025, requires that 75 percent of auto parts be made in North America.

In addition, Honda recently officially announced the launch of two large pure electric vehicles for the U.S. market in 2024, both of which will be equipped with GM's latest Ultium battery pack, which is manufactured by Ultium Cells, a joint venture between LGES and GM. This makes the relationship between these three companies in North America will become even closer.

Another reason is that Japanese battery makers have fallen behind in competition with Chinese and Korean companies across the board. According to market research firm SNE Research, Ningde Times' production capacity reached 67.1 gigawatt hours between January and November last year, up 237.6 percent year-on-year, accounting for 29 percent of the global market share, while LGES' production capacity reached 51.3 gigawatt hours during the same period, taking 22.2 percent of the market share.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8phvw5lgsnb81.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32cc373c50e964fa0199a0f04b137921b8ad5b59

Through their production portfolio and advanced technology, LGES and Ningde Times have gained global leadership and are gradually forming an oligopoly in the market. For LGES, establishing joint ventures with other car companies to share manufacturing costs and ensure stable supply can have a positive effect on the company's long-term development. For Honda, having a battery supplier from the ""first tier"" will help electrify the car.

Kim Pil-soo, a professor at Daelim University in South Korea, observed that the joint venture is a win-win structure that can advance the automaker's electrification transition and provide a stable supply for the battery maker in its sustainable growth. While Honda Motor did not comment, company CEO Toshihiro Mibe said last year that it was willing to form new alliances with other companies for electrification.

**Heavyweight IPO**

For LGES, the news with Honda will be a good thing for its IPO at the end of the month.

According to Bloomberg, LGES will likely price its shares at the top of the range and will raise as much as $10.7 billion, potentially making it the largest IPO in South Korea and the second largest in the world after Rivian ($13.7 billion) in the last year.

Currently, the largest IPO in Korea is Samsung Life Insurance Company, which raised $4.3 billion in 2010, and LGES's IPO will be 2.5 times the size of that deal.",1642168565

392,wallstreetbets,"Tonight's ""scary data"" has the risk of blowing up, how will it stir the market?","The monthly U.S. retail sales rate for December will be released today and the market is expecting a 0% rate, which is lower than the previous value of 0.3%.

Retail data is a key indicator of the state of the U.S. economy, as it shows the spending of U.S. consumers, which accounts for 70% of the U.S. GDP. Previously, this data was also called scary data because it always stirred up big market sentiment, but in recent months, the market impact of retail data has diminished.

So far, U.S. retail sales have increased by about 22% from pre-epidemic levels, even though the job market has not yet returned to pre-epidemic levels. However, this increase is likely to be followed by a narrowing of the trend.

Wells Fargo predicts that U.S. retail sales are likely to be flat in December. It pointed out that retail sales in November has been significantly lower than expected, and the price of essential items such as food and gasoline rose, squeezing consumers to buy optional consumer goods (such as electronics) space. Consumer spending growth is expected to slow further in December, with the monthly rate expected to fall to 0.2%, a four-month low. In addition to rising prices, the Omicron variant of the virus also puts retail sales at downside risk, especially in the service sector.

JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest U.S. credit card issuers, also reported in December that credit card spending in the period from Thanksgiving (Nov. 25) to early December in November 2021 is worse than in 2020 during the pandemic, not to mention 2019 before the epidemic. According to Daniel Silver, an economist at the bank, these figures mean that U.S. retail sales data for December could be more ""pessimistic"".

The latest credit and debit card spending data from Bank of America also indicate that the slowdown in retail sales in December was much larger than the market expected: as shown in the chart below, Bank of America expects December retail sales to register a monthly rate of -1.3%, a 1.6% decline in retail sales excluding autos, and a 2.0% decline in retail sales excluding autos and gasoline.

https://preview.redd.it/clb10znolnb81.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92da195c49a8e9649fd29362f1847bd240c85a8a

Bank of America mentioned that the bigger question is when retail spending will start to show a long-term decline, especially among lower income groups.

In terms of market impact, analysts point out that if the retail data released tonight disappoints, the dollar fears a further blow, thus driving gold prices to continue to rise.

The dollar has been sluggish this week, touching 94.63 from a high of 96.24 at the beginning of the week, and is now running below the 95 mark. Analysts point out that the dollar is struggling to find demand support for the time being, as this week's developments suggest that the Fed can remain patient in terms of policy tightening, and the retail sales report itself is unlikely to change that.

The market has now largely digested the expectation that the Fed will raise interest rates in March. The latest U.S. federal funds rate futures show that the probability of the Fed raising interest rates in March is 90.5%. Wednesday's inflation data was as high as expected at 7%, but the market did not react much because it did not significantly exceed expectations. Also there were no 'hawkish surprises' in Powell's hearings this week.

Technically, the USD Index at 94.60/50 (100-day SMA, former resistance) seems to have formed a strong support area, and a daily closing price below this position would look further down to the 94 handle. If the U.S. index rallies, watch for resistance at 95.20 and the 96 handle.",1642166924

I agree with the author and think we should trade accordingly. That is to BTFD, diamond hands, until Fed raises rates to 1.5-2.0 ish and re-evaluate then.

**The big-name TPG went public, but do you dare to buy the stock?**

The famous private equity firm TPG went public today and closed at a price 15% higher than the IPO price. TPG has been established for 30 years and has a good reputation, but because it is not a public company, the financial situation can only be seen in a fog. Is it better to take advantage of TPG's reputation to charge the stock market, or to slow down and think about one question first - why is a company that has not been listed for 30 years, suddenly listed?

TPG's S1 can be described as extremely complex, 459 pages long (only some time ago Rivian was listed less than 300 pages). Of course, the complexity of S1 proves that the company is willing to disclose, whether you can read it or not is up to your level. You think the purpose of a company going public is just to make money, naive. tpg this round of listing, play is a major transfer of assets.

Let's start with the big picture. According to the company's S1 disclosure, this round of IPO listing, shaving off the old shareholder China Life to sell shares and listing underwriting costs, TPG expected revenue will be $ 820 million (after the green shoe).

https://preview.redd.it/lcpio18z0mb81.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a39fefb7c9e5422dc65f1c41f0f4a9e87ded388

You'd think the $820 million would go into the company's books, but no, the $820 million would first have to go to the company's old shareholders (non-China Life shareholders) for $380 million. Normally, a prospectus can clearly show which old shareholders are selling their shares to exit, but this prospectus does not show that at all. It just says that the $380 million will go to the senior shareholders of a company called TPG Operating Group.

The public offering is of TPG Partners stock, but TPG Partners is a shell company and the real operating company is TPG Operating Group, which is a very powerful move because the shareholders of TPG Operating Group are completely hidden, so it is not known how the $380 million will be distributed to the senior shareholders. The operation of TPG Operating Group was also well hidden through this operation.

The real problem is the transfer of assets since TPG went public. The prospectus did not hide the fact that this operation was called ""reorganization"", and the chart below shows the structure of the company before and after the ""reorganization"" in the prospectus.

https://preview.redd.it/jq56g5c41mb81.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c319044e8e8c4dc39dc76f125dccda0a96ade7ed

Through this IPO, all institutional/retail shareholders received 11% of the actual company and 1.4% of the voting rights, but this does not reflect the true transfer of assets at all.

According to page 126 of the prospectus, in addition to the old shareholders taking $380 million in cash, the old shareholders also divested $1.15 billion of TPG Operating Group's assets through a number of operations.

https://preview.redd.it/3u1scag91mb81.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d2add2414898cfd58f2b58db9622f7bf2533c6

This includes $0.8 billion in cash and two large investments (one $720 million and one $250 million). The $720 million investment is not a public investment and the $250 million is from TPG Group Holdings (SBS). According to the data of the care book, the cost of this investment in 2019 is $180 million, which means that the two-year return reaches 34%.

I do not know what consideration the old shareholders of TPG have taken to divest this $1.1 billion asset from the assets of the listed company, and of course the prospectus will not explain. But this kind of operation will inevitably make people feel that the company has the suspicion of divesting good assets and listing bad assets. If this were listed on the SSE, 100% would receive an inquiry letter from the SEC.

It is usually thought that a company listed, at most, is A shares and B shares, two kinds of equity. But TPG's IPO has created 4 types of shares: ordinary A shares, non-voting A shares, B shares and Common Unit, and it is really a master of equity operation.

481,wallstreetbets,Opinion of the Day| Can TSM keep winning against the cycle?,"On the afternoon of Jan. 13, TSMC released its fourth-quarter fiscal year 2021 results for the year ended Dec. 31. Thanks to the market's continued ""lack of cores,"" the chip foundry giant reported record revenues and profits that exceeded expectations.

Core financial data are as follows.

New high revenue: TSM's revenue reached US$15.74 billion in the fourth quarter, another record quarterly revenue.

Volume and price growth: TSM shipped 37,000 wafers in the fourth quarter, up 2.2% sequentially; TSMC's average wafer shipment price (equivalent 12-inch wafers) was US$4,226 per wafer in the fourth quarter, up 3.5% sequentially.

Profit exceeded expectations: TSM achieved gross profit of $8.29 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8.6% sequentially. Net profit reached a record $6.011 billion, up 16.4% YoY. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.7%, operating profit margin was 41.7% and net profit margin was 37.9%.

TSM also issued new earnings guidance: expected revenue of $16.6-17.2 billion (market expectation of $15.8 billion) and gross margin of 53-55% (market expectation of 51.8%) for the first quarter of 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/ymabgzs20mb81.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a6349ab79a9c4aca329350931a6e5c3dda69511

TSM has been able to achieve such strong growth thanks to the continued strong market demand for chips and two specific perspectives.

On the one hand, there is the stabilization of raw material costs. Previously TSM's other manufacturing expenses grew from $743/chip to $934/chip, with manufacturing costs creating some margin pressure. In the fourth quarter, TSM's other manufacturing expenses declined on a year-over-year basis for the first time, which may continue to fuel further improvement in the company's gross profit level subsequently.

On the other hand, it is driven by the new iPhone. Revenue grew 5.8% YoY in the quarter, driven by higher shipments of 5nm chips from the release of new models from large customers in the US market. This also passed through to higher shipment prices - as most of TSMC's revenue comes from 12-inch wafers and half of it comes from advanced processes, the iPhone 13 series phones boosted TSM's 5nm process share, further boosting the company's gross margin.

https://preview.redd.it/mvvm1a340mb81.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99461e4c50dddfffac4a419ffc038f8a823aa9b4

TSM's shipments continued to grow during the quarter, while the company even raised its quarterly capital expenditures to $8.46 billion. The continued capacity expansion reflects TSM's confidence in the strong demand for wafers. TSM President Chieh-Chih Wei also expects capacity to hold tight in 2022. Therefore, 2022 will be another growth year for TSM.

According to the Taiwan Economic Daily News, dozens of customers such as Super Power, Apple, Pfizer, Qualcomm, etc. have paid TSM in advance to reserve capacity in order to ensure that subsequent shipments are safe. According to a report by market analyst Susquehanna Financial Group, TSM's lead time in December last year increased by 6 days from the previous year to about 25.8 weeks. This also set the highest record for the agency to track the figure since 2017.

But the market is not without concerns about TSM's good performance, with worries centering on the side effects of the current extremely rapid expansion - both in terms of cash flow and future idle capacity.

In the past two years due to the sharp increase in demand for chips, TSM capacity expansion and development is very aggressive (of course, Intel and Samsung are equally aggressive). In order to ensure that the increase in production capacity, the related expenditure also pulled up, especially in the advanced process.

Just recently, TSM formally proposed a 2nm and subsequent 1nm fab expansion plan, with total investment expected to be as high as NT$800 billion to NT$1 trillion (approximately $184-2300 billion), covering nearly 1 million square meters.

Not only is the plant being built, but TSM is also picking up the pace when it comes to process updates. TSM has already started to advance 4nm and 3nm process development. The A15 of iPhone 13 in September this year used TSMC's second generation 5nm process, and the iPhone 14 next year will likely use a 4nm chip. Originally in the fourth quarter of this year before the trial production of the 4nm process process a quarter earlier, and they also announced that they will be in the fourth quarter of 2022 mass production of 3nm process, 2024 will start mass production of 2nm process chips. Wei Zhejia said that 3nm customers ""more than expected"".

In 2021, TSM's capital expenditure is about $30 billion, compared to $14.9 billion in 2019. On the call, TSMC said it is spending $40 billion to $44 billion in 2022 on capital expenditures to expand and upgrade capacity, which is an increase of more than $10 billion over last year.

TSM is also facing pressure from the U.S. stirring up trouble, Intel's return to the foundry business, and the construction of fabs everywhere.

https://preview.redd.it/6ujmflj50mb81.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de1051b0d02b9eacfb30baf5512a36bf34c9fd28

Looking further into the macro, the semiconductor industry is affected by three cycles: the Juglar cycle (the global capital expenditure cycle), the innovation cycle, and the inventory cycle.

At present, the global semiconductor upstream and downstream are in a state of shortage, the whole industry is in active inventory replenishment, pulling the whole industry demand increase, and subsequently bring semiconductor commodity prices, resulting in fab semiconductor companies such as TSMC, Samsung, Hua Hong Semiconductor will enjoy this round of volume and price inventory cycle dividends.

At the same time, the world is in a new round of innovation cycle nodes, algorithms, networks, arithmetic power has further improved, chip architecture, communication technology and OS on the emergence of new technologies, such as 5G cell phones, new energy vehicles, photovoltaic, energy innovation is based on semiconductors, so its demand will further increase.

But it must also be noted that, with the chip shortage gradually alleviated, the supply side of the improvement, the ""cycle"" phase will also change one after another. a recent report by IDC shows that the global chip market is expected to normalize and balance by mid-2022, and in 2023 there may be excess capacity. Semiconductor Intelligence, a consulting firm specializing in chips, also predicts that the global chip industry could see a decline starting in 2023.

An analyst at a head brokerage firm told ""True Detective"", ""There will be less of a shortage of cores in 2022, especially for cell phones, PCs and TVs, to inventory correction."" And Renesas Electronics CEO Hidetoshi Shibata warned the industry must figure out how many orders are ""double orders"" or even ""phantom orders"" and that some prosperity is exaggerated.

At the beginning of 2009, TSM stock price was less than $5. Today TSM stock price has exceeded $100 and total market value is over $600 billion. 2022, various pressures and changes come, can TSM still beat the cycle and keep on winning?",1642146879

493,wallstreetbets,Dopex &gt;&gt;&gt; Robbin-hood,"Dopex is short for  \*D\*ecentralized \*op\*tions \*ex\*change.  


Currently decentralized option protocols seem to share a few problems which are usually:  \* Low liquidity \* Unfair pricing - for buyers and/or writers \* Lack of composability \* Lack of user adoption \* Lack of protocol adoption \* Unfair arb opps during times of high volatility.

 While solving all these problems may seem like a difficult task, dopex team spent quite a bit of time thinking through, building the product and structuring our early partnerships to highly increase dopex' chances of solving them without compromising on the buyer and writer experience.  


Dopex uses an option pool model within which users could add in liquidity to call and put pools using base (weth/wbtc/link etc.) and quote (usd stables) assets. At the end of each epoch (weekly/monthly), the assets are rolled over into the next epoch, allowing for passive LPing for writers. Premiums collected are rolled over into the base/quote assets for the next epoch and liquidity is reset. This allows for an ideal experience in a yield hungry and composable defi space that we are in rn. Of course you may be wondering how this would fare in times of volatility spikes and with a large number of buyers holding doTokens (erc20s representing dopex option positions) - since it could potentially wipe out writers in terms of risk. Well, we have a couple of ways to protect against it:  a) rDPX, the dopex rebate token rDPX is part of the 2 token model of Dopex. It's a no supply cap token that is minted and distributed to pool writers at the end of every epoch relative to a % of losses incurred in $ value during the epoch. The rebate % is decided and kept up to date by governance who pass votes based on their DPX (Dopex governance tokens) weights. The % thresholds are meant to be adjusted over time based on market conditions and to ensure supply and demand are in check to prevent rapid/slow inflation. You may be wondering how rdpx could be valued considering a lack of supply cap. There are a few use cases for the token to ensure it holds its value, such as  i. rdpx/weth LP token is usable for DPX farming ii. rdpx will be a fee requirement for future contracts built over dopex, like say vaults rdpx would be used as collateral for synths, which could be used to create synthetic options for non-blockchain assets iv. fees collected with staking dpx could be boosted with rdpx  the token would also have deflationary properties within the protocol, to balance supply. The 2nd protection against risk for writers would be  b) Fair option pricing  Unlike protocols making use of flat IVs and black-scholes pricing which usually results in incorrect pricing across strikes and expiries especially farther out of the money, dopex uses a combination of RV (realized volatility), a volatility smile replicating formula and ""delegates"" who quote on multipliers that influence the steepness/dampness of curves formed by the pricing formula. This allows for the dopex option chain to be far more realistic and fair in terms of pricing. Delegates are incentivized to quote fair pricing to gain more liquidity and usage of the platform to receive higher incentives such as pool rewards and platform fees. They are also penalized incase of inactivity and/or malicious/incorrect reporting. So who are these delegates? To begin with we handpicked 5 of the largest derivative trading firms in the blockchain space to be dopex delegates since they have the expertise, knowledge, data and resources to provide accurate fair pricing for all dopex option chains. With billions in blockchain derivative volume every quarter and backgrounds in tradfi as well as defi more recently, dopex will probably have the best priced options in the space with pooled (high) liquidity across the space - which could possibly even rival centralized exchanges down the line, while providing aptly priced options while accounting for risk in near real time. But ethireeeum mainnet may be too slow for real time updates, how do we solve that? Well, we're scheduled to launch on optimism after it's live to mitigate high fees and decrease txn times for users to replicate a cex-perience. We also have plans for tick based liquidity pools for all doTokens on uni v3, allowing for instant liquidity for option buyers and sellers.  Okay, technically all of it sounds good. But what're dopex' plans for adoption? We agree that on-chain adoption hasn't been as expected for most protocols until now, which's why we took a look at deribit - which still makes up for 80%+ of all blockchain option volume - to take a few hints.  Dopex' model would be to attain retail liquidity while offering the best tools and experience for seasoned option traders, desks etc. who actually do all the option volume these days to actually purchase the options.  Dopex incentivizes them with token rewards, arb opps (volume pool), fair option pricing, deep liquidity, as well as block trades in the future to make the protocol more attractive. This way we would have the best of both worlds for retail users in terms of accessing yield opps as well as option traders looking to hedge, speculate etc.

today i will be watching for 2 key resistance to break before i jump on calls.
if we can hold support here without dipping below 463.4-464 thats overall bullish. 
resistance is going to come into play at 466.6 ---&gt; 467.5 (where we bounced before dipping lower and where we rejected to candles after hours... this is the true resistance) ---&gt; if we can break 467.5 we should retest the hard resistance at 472. theres a very real chance we are rejected there. 

if we fall below that 463.4 ill be looking for a 459 bounce. 

though if we initially hold support, futures stay green and bitty to stays green i will buy the next  OTM call 14 DTE at open. I will let that call ride until we test resistance at 472 (with a tight stop loss initially then profit take). I feel like due to the 15 min through 2 hour RSI all being over sold it makes sense to pop. though if we look at 1/5 after a very similiar sell off we traded sideways and dipped the following day.",1642143956

Putin threatened the U.S., saying, ""if you sanction us, we will sever all ties.""  NATO is on high alert, saying that this is a very dire and difficult situation.  Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau warned today that the ""risk of war in the area is now greater than ever before in the last 30 years.""

Meanwhile, Putin has worked alongside Jinping and Kim Jong-un, sharing advanced military technology for over a decade.  Most recently, they succeeded with hypersonic missile tests.  China has been militarizing islands in the South China Sea for about a decade.  Further, China has also harnessed nuclear fusion.  China, who claims Taiwan as their own, will likely invade Taiwan.  All three of these nations are seemingly riding a 'confidence high', likely based on the technological achievements over the last decade, and it is giving Putin the confidence he needs to reform the USSR.

At a time when the U.S. is the most infected country -  by a virus that first started spreading in the Wuhan region of China - and at a time when the U.S. is the most targeted country via cyberattacks, I'd say the initial conditions are set for a World War.

Because metal shortage is currently ongoing. Sending these ppl steel dildos has two results: 

A:The steel dildos are almost 3 pounds (https://supersmashcache.com/njoy-eleven-stainless-steel-dildo-review/) and there are 800+ IB men. That is 2400+ pounds of metal being wasted. 

That steel could be used for a few cars, appliances, whatever. The sudden lack of demand in this side and a sudden influx of demand in metal dildos causes a supply chain solution because now shipping companies have to adjust for a change by reducing cargo space for the big things by switching to small cargo containers for the dildos. This reduction in space also allows other items to be put on ships. This reduces congestion. 

At the same time, with less cars, appliances, etc to be produced, there is a reduction in the chip usage helping everyone buy their PS5’s and lessening the issue. 

Eventually, this creates a positive feedback loop and the global economy is fixed. 

B: You can help literally fuck the hedgies. 

TLDR: Buy steel dildos and ship them to your local IB.",1642115035

WTRH is responsible for approximately 1% of US food delivery sales, far behind competitors such as DASH 57% and GRUB 15%, so it’s understandable that the company would have a significantly lower valuation than these other publicly traded competitors.  However WTRH has been beat down something fierce with a current market cap &lt; .09 billion. DASH’s market cap &gt; 45 billion  GRUB’s market cap &gt; 23 billion. 

Not saying that WTRH is going to take over the industry but given their current share of the marketplace and that they are rapidly expanding their user base, there is no justifiable reason for WTRH to hold such a low valuation compared to other publicly traded corps in the same industry.

Also WTRH has been reporting better earnings per share than its competitors.",1642111267

801,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club Changes From Free to Paid On Tuesday,"I'm probably the foremost defender of Jim Cramer on this subreddit.    The hate and misinformation that spreads here is insane.  

I can defend his life's story and actions over the decades.  I've explained why the repetitive supposed exposes of his methods and motives are usually false and salacious.  

Where I *don't* have the knowledge and ammunition is in his advice club subscriptions over the years, and what's happening with this latest iteration.  

It's unclear to me what devolved and happened with the former action alerts relationship.  It looks like it may have ended acrimoniously, based on Cramer's curt comments. 

I was happy to see the launch of the free CNBC version and there was zero indication it was a temporary free trial.  But now, after months of relentless promotion by the whole network, it's ""transitioning"" to an expensive subscription.  The list price is unclear, but early adopters are being told their discount price will be $250.

This disappoints me.  It's unnecessary and appears to have been a planned maneuver all along.  It's something I don't know how to defend.  

Cramer's careful wording of late is building towards this switch over, claiming in recent weeks that the club would somehow be getting better, with timeline matching the planned flip to paid mode.

Regarding the charitable trust itself, I can defend the investment selections, but I don't have the information to defend the charity itself.  How and when is charity disbursed and what are the inflows/outflows?  I don't know, and I'm his main defender on Reddit.

This is all pretty unfortunate.  A free advice column would serve the same purpose and make it easy for me to defend Cramer's self-identity as a an information sharer and educator.  A pay-for-play column makes that harder to do.

It's also probably unnecessary.  Free trade tracking is available everywhere, from various people.  It benefits the image of whichever public figure is doing it, and it indirectly helps their investment thesis.  We see this with Ark, who reveals trades daily instead of waiting for quarterly reports.  

The trade tracking is hardly earth shaking anyway.  The makeup of the $4 million AUM charity trust is fairly vanilla, full of household names like Apple and Honeywell.  That's fine, as it's supposed to be a stable but equity powered charity, not a gambling fund.  But the dollar value of that information is inherent limited. 

If anyone has hard facts on the actual mechanics of the charity trust and how the paid subscription dollars flow, I'd be keenly interested.",1642109308

Looking for other's opinions here.  I followed Ford for the last 18 months and felt their price was off because they made their own batteries, have nice EVs, and have a self driving vehicle solution.  They went from a P/E of 9 to 35 in this time and I didn't buy any because of other interests.  

So now I'm looking at GM and don't want to miss out again.  Their EV fleet really doesn't come strong until 2023 that I can see, but they have their own battery solution, and self driving software.  Their self driving is supposed to be geared towards robo taxis from what I read too (Uber?).  Tesla is selling their software for $12,000 and is valued at a higher PE multiple because they are a tech company.  Is there a reason GM can't do this?

In yall's opinion, will their Cruise self driving capability or any other similarities to Tesla/Ford make GM P/E valued with a similar P/E multiple?  I can see GM at four times the current price because their multiple is like 8.  Is there a difference between these vehicle manufacturers that I am missing or is this a smart play?  I want to put in like half my money, which is risky.",1642109044

We all know that central banks will be winding down its nearly $9T balance sheet + talks of 3 separate interest rates hikes starting in March will cause for a choppy market. For you WSB retards, higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, slowing down demand, growth, innovation and incentivizing more saving cause prices to go down. Demand is still red hot across sectors. Hell, luxury car make Rolls-Royce sold more cars in 2021 than any other in it's 117 year history. The supply chain is constrained. What if when those supply chains catch up with demand, inflation will start to cool organically and less FED intervention is needed. Data analytic companies like PLTR in time will help with supply chain inefficiency. Cathie Wood and her bullish outlook on robots will make manufacturing more efficient. Tesla Bot in 2022 anyone? Maybe I'm a retard with being too forward looking with these innovations that may be deflationary for certain sectors, but every time the FED speaks, the market is so sensitive to it. Maybe they should wait it out? Or keep the interest rate hike to a minimum? Smart money is pouring into dinosaur companies again with ""fair"" valuations while growth stocks continue to get killed. I'm dead inside and will continue to average down into solid growth companies at hopefully bargain prices if the FED keeps crashing the market.

841,wallstreetbets,Today's Lesson: How To Become A Bagholder In 10 Days,"Gather round kids.

Time to shares with you the secrets of becoming a bagholder.

First lesson. Buy an overpriced expensive stock just because everyone else is doing it.

Case in point. GameStop. A whole bunch of retards followed DFV into the biggest meme in history. They bought and bought and bought and bought until it mooned and then they eventually thought that some internet guy who sells adult dog toys would turn GameStop into the next Amazon.

Well, it didn't moon because GameStop will become the next Amazon. It didn't moon because they hired the castoffs from Amazon and other large companies. It mooned because a bunch of lemmings with stimulus checks and past due rent payments decided to yolo into a stock that was heavily shorted and got huge press from DFV.

Now that you can see the moon, you should realize that it's time to sell. Not because you're in the green, but because you're about to be in the red.

Second lesson. Hold on to an overpriced stock until it round trips and goes through the floor. 

Case in point. AMC. A whole bunch of mouth breathers decided to follow some dumb post saying that they could do the same thing for AMC that they did for GameStop. That for some reason it made sense to do a bail out on a company that sells overpriced pop corn and charges you $15 to see a movie that you can see for free on HBO Max.

Well, guess what. You're might be one of the shareholders in the green, but that doesn't mean you'll stay there. Why? Because the very people who work for you are selling their shares.

But wait. How can that do that? They work for us, right? Nope. You're the mark. You're the dumb money. You're the bagholder in an abusive relationship where your partner tells you to buy nice things while they are turning around and selling them at the Pawn Shop for pennies on the dollar. For those familiar with the parlance. It's called dilution. And it is the reason you'll be a bagholder if you don't sell.

Well, that's it for today.

Perhaps we'll go over the lessons taught by Chammath next week.

Until then, don't be a bagholder.

What’s the play: 
- buy calls on the scared boomers and earnings. 

What’s happening: 
- As the title says, Boomers are scared the fed is going to steal all their party raid loot through inflation - so they’re buying BTI for the 7% dividend yield to hide from the casino. 

- BTI’s market cap is big enough that funds, pensions, and managers can get in, so they’re all trying to do it quietly before everyone knows (been 1-2% gains a day) 

- now this week they’re running over each other, outbidding themselves before everyone notices but I fucking found their ass. 

- RSI is in the 80’s, but that doesn’t worry me because there’s no reason to sell for them, AND it just broke the 52 week high today, so no lame bag holders to worry about!

Highlights: LOW BETA 
- its been a dividend stock during the bull market, so it had no interest last year so options are cheap. 

Highlights: AUTIST YOAT Earnings is in February
- they’re a British adr so they have fiscal year halves, not quarters, so this is two earnings in one. (You only Announce Twice)

Highlights: the dividend is safe, no reason to sell. 
- in December the CEO Professionally told everyone to get rekt and hold his pocket when earnings come out, he’s tired of the crying. He said earnings will be at the ‘top end of guidance’ and that “they recognize the value of a share buy back at these levels.”

- so what he did here is say they’ve achieved Atleast the base earnings to keep the dividend, but also it could be raised, but if people won’t value the dividend then they are going to introduce  a share back so he’s basically saying “if y’all don’t buy this stock I’m going to buy it because you don’t know math.”

- highlights: they own VUSE which I use to bust fat clouds, that’s how I found them tbh. 
- VUSE just overtook juul as the number one vape in the US and Canada. This will be in this earnings.

900,wallstreetbets,The Big Short Pt. 2,"  

**Hello fellow degenerates, here is a small DD on what I think will potentially be one of the biggest plays you can make.**

*NOTE: This was written before SQQQ did a reverse split*

***Part 1 - The Objective***

*The SQQQ is the short index fund on the QQQ, following an inverse play of the QQQ performance. The play is to buy long SQQQ which will run opposite of QQQ movement.*

WHEN the QQQ crashes, so will SPY, RUSSELL ETC. The only issue is calculating this timeframe. The timeframe can be calculated by finding past patterns, and predicting which months it will happen. However, this calculation is complicated and will be discussed below.

**Part 2 - Predictions**

The QQQ/SPY will certainly crash when no one is expecting, as in 2008, housing markets were at an all time high for years, no one expected a crash, there was no patterns to find, but Michael Burry figured it out. He will figure it out again as he has been saying through blog posts, tweets etc. this will be the biggest crash of all. SPY will crash 30%-50% but of course this can be over a course of a day, a week or several months and slowly bleed.

*Catalysts*

*Big tech.* As my username shows, I am long and short on big tech (AAPL, AMD, MSFT, FB) as these are growth stocks and will forever have potential. However, these have been at an all time high for years and can continue to rise. We currently see many of these sitting way higher than they should, NVDA is a good example and of course everyone's favorite, $TSLA. Of course these companies have good fundamentals but the market will correct, and when it does these will be some of the first to drop harshly.

It might not be obvious when the market will crash but it is blatantly obvious some of these are so overvalued, they should only be shorted. Mr Burry has been throwing millions into $TSLA shorts until he liquidated his position earlier this year as he stated its just an irrational stock that makes no sense at the price it performs at but it will soon be corrected.

**Part 3 - The Play**

**a) Wait till inflation rises more**

Inflation currently sitting at ***6.8% is the highest its been since 1982 when the market had a recession.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z8jqxnafbib81.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=074ee88c552711baa47decef33b9867d1445c52a

Inflation during 1982 Recession

In 1977 inflation is what it was now, and it only took 3 years to rise to another all time high. Of course history repeats itself, and we are on the verge of reaching these numbers again.  
 I believe this will take less than a year, **unless the government is able to reduce inflation through rate hikes which will be explained in b)**

**b) Rate hikes 3x**

The USA government has announced a week ago that there will be 3 rate hikes in 2022, and 3 more in 2023 to try and curb inflation. These rate hikes will **100%** start to make the market pull back. Lower inflation means a market correction which will pull back big tech, QQQ and SPY as a result. How much? This is unknown but it will occur soon, first rate hike \~3 months of 2022.

Depending how the market reacts, it will pull back slowly or crash suddenly, when everything is even higher than it is right now. ***It may be smart to get in before the first rate hike, but its possible this process takes a year or longer.***

**c) Position**

This is hard to post my position as I am extremely bearish on the whole situation, but since the timeframe is so uncertain and being far off can result in a large loss. I plan to slowly buy SQQQ shares rising until the first rate hike and buy long calls on SQQQ, long puts on QQQ and SPY.

**Long position:**

· SQQQ Jan 20, 2023, 15C

· SQQQ Jan 19, 2024, 18C

· SPY Jan 20 2023, 300P

· SPY Jan 19 2024, 300P

· QQQ Jun 16, 2023

**Short positions:**

· QQQ Jun 17, 2022 300P

· QQQ Dec 16, 2022 300P

· SPY May 20, 2022 400P

· SQQQ Jun 17, 2022 9C

· SPY May 20, 2022 400P

**Reasoning:**

Long positions after September since past crashes happened during this time, and often the new year has big sell offs regardless of a crash.  
 Short positions after spring, when rate hikes will be in play and right when I predict the potential of an earlier crash when everything will potentially be valued even higher than it is now.

**Part 4 - Summary**

This is not just a coin flip, we all know the market will have a major pullback, I could certainly have put articles, financial data, analysis reports, etc. into this DD, but it is a short summary of what will potentially happen. Regardless if it takes a few months to several years, it may be smart to get in sooner than later. Good luck to all the bulls against my position, I still have shares/options in bullish positions as well, but these will not last much longer.",1642102256

In order to prevent the same thing that happened with $GME last year around the  first great spike. When market makers and the DTC came before congress  they all said the spike happened because of a people buying crazy amounts of options that caused call sellers to delta hedge aka buy more shares. And next  week is looking like its might get a bit chaotic again with so many options already bought if the price spikes again it would get crazy. 

What are your guys thoughts on $GME running again like on the anniversary of its first spike. I think its just a matter of time.

People have bet over half of $GME market cap into calls that expire next week and I think its the reason we are seeing such low prices right now for $GME. In order to prevent the same thing that happened with $GME last year around the first great spike. When market makers and the DTC came before congress they all said the spike happened because of a gamma squeeze. And next week is looking like perfect set-up for another one. If you want to profit of this possibility. I'd recommend buying itm calls and near the money otm calls but its your money so do what you want.

What are your guys thoughts on $GME running again like on the anniversary of its first spike.

I know that everyone made money already the last time it dropped down to $10 per share, but you have one more opportunity today. Especially since I saw his interview on CNBC, where they are just creating two more shuttles for of the tourists flights next year.

He also stated that he is making upgrades and modifications to the ""flagship shuttle"" which I believe means making it a little bigger with larger window space for all those celebrities who have booked their flights. As soon as the first tourists take off, the stock is going to hit at least $30-$60 per share, in my humble opinion once again. And there is no pushing back the flight times. They will start in November. This will be the lowest-priced sense March 2020.

942,wallstreetbets,The biggest monopoly that you guys have never heard of," 

Hi guys, I wanted to point you out to what could possibly be the biggest monopoly in the history. ASML is a company that makes lithography machines, basically they make the technology that empowers chip makers like TSMC, INTEL, SAMSUNG, ETC. There isn't any company that comes even close to their technology, and everyone who even considers making advanced semiconductors must have their machines.

ASML has been growing for around 35% year over year, and I think that some investment funds still don't understand how much power and leverage this company has. According to some of my friends who work in the semi-conductor industry, even if in the future there will be a company that can make machines which are good as ASML makes, no one will buy them because all the chip makers build their systems on top of ASML's machines. Basically, switching machines will be almost impossible.

Now, chip in the fact that most of their earnings come from ""support"" and monthly payments and not related to sales of those machines -&gt; Consider the politic environment (the trade wars) and the fact that many new fabrication plants will be opened because of that -&gt; you can the ultimate blood sucking animal which is ASML. On top of that, ASML is a European country, so far it is not allowed to sell machines to China, but they are not as unlikely as a company that's based in the US. So if the political environment will change in the future it is very possible that they will experience a serious growth by entering China.

I do not know how long they can continue to grow so fast, but I definitely can imagine that in a couple of years it could be worth 1 Trillion and by then have a slower growth but very steady profits, and become an insane dividend stock.",1642098603

And at what rate? Do you plan on reducing your margin amount as rates increase this year and if so, how/how much? 

I.e. I’m currently borrowing about 47% of my portfolio’s value in margin (not including retirement accounts, which you can’t take margin out on). I plan to reduce this to about 25-30% by year-end depending on the speed of rate hikes.

It’s interesting to consider how high margin debt is (918.6 billion as of 11/30) as rates start increasing this year; is there any relatively recent empirical research exploring individual investors’/funds’ sensitivity to rate hikes in terms of margin?

This might be an interesting start:

Solid Power replaces the flammable liquid electrolyte in a conventional lithium-ion battery with a proprietary sulfide-based solid electrolyte. As a result, Solid Power's all-solid-state battery cells are expected to be safer and more stable across a broad temperature range, provide an increase in energy density compared to the best available rechargeable battery cells, enable less expensive, more energy-dense battery pack designs and be compatible with traditional lithium-ion manufacturing processes.

1) Disabling the buy button.
Already lost a lawsuit on this, and everyone knows it was shady af.

2) Their earnings reports indicate that most of their crapto earnings came from selling users dog coin, which has now collapsed. Additionally, they were acting as a market maker selling users dog coin they acquired, rather than acting as an intermediary. Coinbase et Al can get away with this because they're not SEC registered brokers, but Robinhood has agreed to be bound by certain rules.
The SEC won't look kindly on a registered broker selling unregistered securities and manipulating the prices of cryptocurrency.

3) Payment for order flow, the core of their business, is being looked into by the SEC. If they take regulatory action against this, the entire Robinhood business is doomed.

1011,wallstreetbets,I AM THE ONE WHO NOKS: Crazy OI on Nokia Jan. 21 Calls,"Hey, longtime lurker, first time poster. I just came here to point out the insane fucking OI on Nokia stock for next week. 

I noticed it a couple months ago and have been following the stock through its steady rise. Normally the weekly OI for the stock is something like 10,000 contracts (very rough estimate), and normally most of the contracts expire worthless (as per Max Pain theory). For example, here's a screenshot of the calls for this week:

&amp;#x200B;

And here's what the calls for next week look like:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/an7kknbodhb81.png?width=250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2877b2eed99c6a21bfff48ee11c7891474c2c15d

What does it all mean? I don't know, I'm an idiot. What I do know is that over 400,000 calls are in the money for next week, equivalent to over 40,000,000 shares. 

That's OVER 40 MILLION SHARES in the money for next week, on a stock with an average daily volume of 20 million.

I haven't been able to figure out why this setup exists, but I don't see how it doesn't push the price up over the next couple weeks.

Like, maybe a lot.

And for those of you who care about fundamentals, Nokia is a good company. After getting fucked in the smartphone business by Apple and other rivals, in recent years Nokia transformed itself into a 5G leader, to the point where analysts are now calling it a ['value technology play'](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nokia-is-gradually-transforming-into-a-value-technology-play). 5G is the next big thing in mobile communications, so that's a good position to be in. This week Nokia issued a [very reassuring guidance](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/nokia-exceed-2021-guidance-2022-01-11/) for 2022 despite the global chip shortage, and it's going to report earnings on February 3 – after almost HALF A MILLION CALLS GET EXERCISED NEXT WEEK.",1642092170

1025,wallstreetbets,Should I $GRAB and hold this diamond or cut it loose?,"$GRAB is basically a South East Asian Uber/Eats/Apple Pay/Instacart. The company recently SPAC on the American exchanges a few months ago. It promptly crashed immediately after. I averaged down my position and have been holding it since making small amounts of profits to off set my loss on covered calls. As the share price continues to drift slowly downward I am becoming concerned.

I have done some DD on this company and I am incredibly pleased from a fundamentals perspective. The CEO seems to have a solid handle on their operation. They actually pushed Uber, their main rival out of their operating area and convinced Uber to take a stock offering for their SEA operations. The APP looks nice, intuitive and easy to use. The primary SPAC investors are in a lockup agreement for atleast 2 years out from the merger date and there are some other big names holding interest in the company such as Toyota, and Morgan Stanley. 

The only real thing I don't like as an investor is their shares outstanding. 3.7 Billion shares outstanding and 2.58 billion free float. SI is incredibly low off the SPAC crash so shorts are no longer pressing down the share price it seems. The company does have a negative P/E, but it also has enough liquid assets to fuel aggressive growth for at least 2 years.

TL:DR I like Grab but it's getting to a point I may exit based on technical exit plan. Fellow retards, what are your thoughts?",1642091202

I am a firm libtard, and I very much am anti-Trump. Now that we’ve got the politics out of the way, for those who don’t know, $DWAC is the SPAC taking Trump’s Media and TV Group company public. It is currently all vapourware. It is likely to result in a Twitter clone called Truth Social, which will become an echo chamber for hate and likely be sued to death. But it’s in the middle of a short gamma squeeze we haven’t seen since this time last year.

1029,wallstreetbets,Cannabis shift from Canadian LPs to U.S. MSOs,"Over the past year we have witnessed a shift from domination by Canadian cannabis companies, to U.S. MSOs taking a larger share of the global market and growing their sales while also posting positive income figures.

Recently Tilray released their Q2 results, and while some investors look at headlines and think that Tilray had a good quarter of positive income and growing sales, there is a lot to uncover from the report.

Tilray continues to be a shining example of how easy it is to mislead the investor community and press alike with a PR:
-Mentions 20% yoy growth, leaving out that this year includes the combined Tilray+ Aphria. No mention of big QOQ drop or actual YOY drop of legacy operations
-Leads PR with mention of $6M in net income compared to a $89M net-loss a year ago. No mention that the gain this quarter stems entirely from $64.75M in non-operating income as a result of their share price dropping and subsequent change in derivative liabilities of convertible debt. Operating loss was deeply negative without this non-cash adjustment (gross profit was $32.7M relative to operating expenses of $87.5M!)
-Highlights leading market share in Canada- no mention of how this evolved QOQ or YOY. Hint- it has fallen like a brick.
-Highlights $13.76M in adjusted EBiDTA. Adjustments removed $8.12M in transaction costs, $12M in write-downs, $8.3M in SBC, $1.7M in one-time costs. Actual EBIDTA negative then
-So while GMs were just 21%, operating loss was $54.86M, unadjusted EBIDTA was negative, operating cash flow loss was $17.12M, revenue missed estimates by $17M, we still have Tilray claiming a “profitable” quarter and the news media with headlines on Tilray’s surprise Q2 profit.
-Tilray Q2 top-line over previous quarter:
Cannabis sales: 🔻16.6%
Beverage alcohol sales: 🔻11.3%
Wellness sales: 🔻 7.5%
Distribution sales: up 2.5%

On the other hand, while U.S. MSOs have also seen declining share prices, their financial performance has been strong, even with slower sales in Q3 2021. Prices and multiples have been depressed, and with sales in many U.S. states setting records, it is entirely possible that the growth these companies have been showing will continue.

1030,wallstreetbets,Should Apple Acquire Rite Aid Pharmacy?,"  

I have a crazy idea and a question; should Apple consider acquiring Rite Aid pharmacy? As Apple ramps up its medical uses of its smart watch, such as the ECG capability, one has to wonder if Apple might acquire a pharmacy chain like Rite Aid to sell this device directly to customers who it would most benefit. Rite Aid customers, coming in to fill scripts or seek medical advice from a pharmacist, would be ripe to learn about the watch’s many medical benefits to enhance and ease every their everyday medical concerns and issues. Having the devices for sale in the Rite Aid stores should lead to more familiarity with their possibilities and applications. It would be a way of pitching the device often to someone who is at the pharmacy for medical related issues. Presumably many of the Rite Aid and potential Apple customers would be exposed more to the watch at the local pharmacy they frequently visit, as opposed to an Apple store or electronics retailer like Best Buy. Rite Aid’s debt would be pennies for Apple, and Apple would have something to play around with close to their mother ship with Rite Aid's significant west coast presence.

Most are familiar with their brand and the kits now sell at Walmart. The stock is rated by all the big dogs at a $13 price point, the fundamentals back it. The only reason the stock isn't performing well is due to short interest and low volume. Want a modest 2x return over the next quarter? That's what my play is. Of course this isn't investment advice, but I'm a deep value trader just like I was on Gamestop. I like fundamentals and looking at brand loyalty as a qualitative measure.

Following my Dec 13th DD post on $LWLG, [which you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rfn1yq/puts_on_lwlg_hedge_fund_managed_share_selling/), many of you have been sending me truly amusing bits of info about the company. So, I decided to do a one month update with some ""crowdsourced DD"", for everyone's entertainment.

Thanks to everyone who contributed!

**Stock performance and insider activity**

$LWLG had some very remarkable performance in the last month, down a solid 35% on no negative news (just a couple of bs PRs). Since I've seen bagholders on r/lwlg and elsewhere blaming it on the market, I just wanted to point out, in the same period of time: Nasdaq -1.5%, S&amp;P +1.5%, Dow +2%. All of them near ATHs.

[Insiders have been dumping shares](https://www.insider-monitor.com/trading/cik1325964.html) for a few million dollars, since they strongly believe in the future of the company. Options on 800k shares were exercised, and 804k were sold, but somehow I've seen people justifying this as due to the tax burden of options exercises. 

**A new line of business for LWLG**

As we know, LWLG signed an agreement with Lincoln Park Capital, allowing them to sell more shares to bagholders. We all thought these funds would be used to fund the development of their polymer photonics. But this time again, another pleasant surprise from Dr. Lebby, world renowned expert of photonics and drug development: LWLG is getting into biotech!

[Looking forward to seeing the results of their clinical trials](https://preview.redd.it/h96bedx6ogb81.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2f1a397a0649119e3aae8bdf6febcd6e1988c30)

This is in the [prospectus](https://dd7pmep5szm19.cloudfront.net/2586/0001553350-21-000878.htm) of their share selling agreement, page S-3. Could lead someone to suspect this wasn't prepared, or even checked, by LWLG. Maybe someone with a lot of experience in share selling agreement could have helped, like a vulture hedge fund experienced in extracting wealth from shareholders of distressed companies...  but who could this be?

**Foundry partnership &amp; revenue update**

As you may have read in the last post, many $LWLG bulltards were convinced a foundry partnership would be announced at the Oppenheimer conference on Dec. 14th. Could you guess what happened?

A user with some time to waste watched the whole conference, and found the answer:

[""When should we expect partnership/revenue guidance timelines? How long have you been working with telcos?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHEKkuR5FFo&amp;t=1897s)

His comment on the subject: ""This company is dogshit, and this moment in the presentation proved it to me""

**Déjà vu?**

Did the previous video sound familiar? For the next funny bit, we need to thank a dude called Atlsutiger from stocktwits. So, according to this, it turns out that in Feb 2020, ""Tier A"" partners already had prototypes in their hands. Two years laters, we still have to hear about any of them. As we all know, the semiconductor industry is a notoriously slow one.

[""How soon would any of this be in use?""](https://youtu.be/LPXQbebgZ1Q)

Some may start wondering if these partners exist or are just...

[You know what a fugazi is?](https://i.redd.it/9vqw3gajogb81.gif)

**Days of future past**

This is probably my favorite. Another user, aka the flying dutchman, noticed this paragraph in the latest $LWLG PR:

&gt;""We are very excited. This is the final step in the development process. The marriage of the chromophore and the spacer system is now complete and the combined material has been delivered to our partner, Photon-X, who will fabricate a prototype polymer optical modulator and measure its technical properties. We are still on schedule to demonstrate this prototype early next quarter. It is this demonstration that will move us into the commercialization phase and to the next stage in conversations with potential customers and partners. Potential customers have told me in no uncertain terms that they are very excited about our polymer, and eagerly anticipate our demonstration.""

# Oh wait, this is a PR [from fucking 2008](http://www.wallstreetweb.nl/community/viewtopic.php?t=3542&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0)!

Weird, one could hardly tell it's not from this year. The issue with the internet is that shit stays there indefinitely.

Anyway, this forum is a goldmine. You can literally find all of [today's LWLG talking points](https://www.reddit.com/r/LWLG/comments/rv6dhs/comments_on_recent_nr/), just a decade earlier. So much faster than silicon photonics, energy savings, improved r33, temperature stability, revenue coming soon, etc.

Page 6, CTO was saying this in 2009:

&gt;The test data shows that we can actually obtain r33 values higher than we reported in 2006. In addition, we have monitored the r33 value of several chips over time and the r33 value has not diminished over a 6-month period after the original testing occurred.

And this is Jim, then CEO:

&gt;We are now in discussion with several potential customers who should begin initial testing of our proprietary platform in the coming weeks,

Or a 2010 letter to the shareholders:

&gt;As Lightwave Logic evolves from a developmental/technology stage to a material and product production stage, we expect that the company will report initial revenues in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2010, and see meaningful revenues in 2011.

Anyway, turns out it's been 14 years that LWLG is moving to the commercialization phase soon. And I'm sure potential customers are still very excited.

**The shill factory**

A guy in r/lwlg used a bunch of tools to analyze the users of the sub, and seems to be getting suspicious. Here are his findings:

[r\/lwlg users don't have many other interests](https://preview.redd.it/6phlnpt5pgb81.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=280c531e3032f0d1792c9e27de93a0e9b367c969)

Here's what he found on one of the most frequent commenters:

[This user in particular](https://preview.redd.it/e1igwkydpgb81.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d43fc59bfa9b44d636a8a52df510adb00c46199)

Anyway, [this is the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LWLG/comments/rscq02/lwlg_positions/), more fun stuff in it, like a dude who holds shares since 2005 and guess what, he created his account two days after r/lwlg. The guy seems to be suspecting that the sub may be a stock promotion effort by Lincoln Park Capital, and from his analysis it would sound plausible. u/newusernamecoming, you may want to check us out!

**Comments from the neighbors**

A couple of people mentioned in the comments to my previous post that they work in the same industrial area of LWLG in Englewood, CO. Here are the comments from the WSB gang:

[Polymer photonics and homelessness](https://preview.redd.it/df6qogvkpgb81.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d59a5857f06fcda20d7387b5672551cd074252f)

And here's another one:

It appears at LWLG they're capable of doing groundbreaking semiconductor/photonics research not only on a slim budget (few M$/y), but also without anyone showing up at their lab. Shouldn't surprise anyone, after all, [their CEO lives in San Francisco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lebby).

We may be receiving pics of the situation very soon, in which case I'll add them to this post (or suggest the guy to make his own post, in case he wants some karma), so maybe check back tomorrow.

Thank you! Also, really sorry you lost a third of your one year income in a month, hope at least you didn't buy those calls.

**For the wannabe scambusters:** I'm considering to recruit retards with good DD skills to go after other scams by Lincoln Park Capital and other vulture hedge funds. Will post about it soon, stay tuned.

That's all folks! Congrats on the gains to those who shorted/bought long term investment-grade put options!

1092,wallstreetbets,"40 years of change: the last time the CPI ""7 times"" what happened?","Data released by the U.S. Department of Labor on Wednesday showed that the U.S. CPI data in December rose 7.0% year-on-year, officially entering the ""7 era,"" and the last time U.S. prices rose to such a high level, but also tracked back to the summer of 1982. Nearly four decades of change, both the global and U.S. economic and political landscape, have undergone a radical transformation. So, can the historical case provide insight for people today?

On Twitter, a tweet from an industry insider stirred up memories that many older people have kept for decades.

https://preview.redd.it/ojbnvl8csgb81.jpg?width=591&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41f395399bb9c77073997b129747fdff0e842c37

**The last time the U.S. CPI was in the ""7 era,"" the S&amp;P 500, which is now at over 4,700 points, was still at a triple-digit start of 100 points; the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate was above 10%; and the 10-year U.S. bond yield was at what now seems like an incredibly high 15%. Of course, what makes the change over the years even more profound is that China's GDP was only about 1.5% of its current size (in dollar terms) back then.**

But in fact, in many people's view, in addition to the CPI is also in the ""7 era"", the current situation of the U.S. economy and financial markets, and 40 years ago there are not many similarities.

**The experience of 40 years ago**

**Today, the U.S. inflation rate is still on the rise, while the summer of 1982 is in a period of decline.**

In 1980, the U.S. CPI year-on-year increase had reached a peak of 14.8%, when the U.S. President or Jimmy Carter (Jimmy Carter), the Iranian revolution that broke out in 1979 pushed up oil prices, when the U.S. core inflation rate also reached a horrific high of 13.6%.

Paul Volcker (Paul Volcker) became chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1979, then began to use tight monetary policy to try to curb inflation. This approach, combined with credit controls, led the United States into a brief recession in 1980. A much more severe recession then erupted when the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate further to 19% in 1981. By the summer of 1982, both inflation and interest rates began to fall sharply.

The story since then is well known today, with the U.S. experiencing a nearly 40-year period of low-single-digit inflation.

https://preview.redd.it/ki1vf5kgsgb81.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b9a5b1417d584bb4ddb84ac405808ff7af4b82

**In August 1982, a Fed official had excitedly said, ""We've had great success in reducing inflation."" But it was clear that Volcker, then chairman of the Fed, had many other difficult issues to deal with at the time: his high interest rate policy led Mexico into default and triggered a debt crisis in Latin America; that fall, the U.S. unemployment rate also climbed to a post-World War II high - 10.8%.**

At the time, the Fed's monetary policy objectives were also very different from today. in 1982, the Fed was still targeting the money supply, resulting in often unpredictable interest rate fluctuations. And to this day, the Fed has largely ignored the money supply indicator, which has expanded dramatically in recent years as the Fed buys bonds to hold down long-term interest rates, while the federal funds rate now remains close to zero.

**An earlier case**

**It is worth noting that two earlier cases in U.S. history when the CPI reached 7%, compared to 1982, may be more relevant for people today.**

The first was in 1946. The first time was in 1946, when the end of World War II unleashed pent-up demand for consumer goods and price controls were lifted with the end of the war, with inflation reaching nearly 20% in 1947 before falling all the way back down. Today, U.S. consumption patterns are similarly distorted, with supply chains disrupted by epidemics.

The U.S. CPI also exceeded 7% in 1973, although this was driven in part by soaring food and energy prices (the outbreak of the first oil crisis) and continued the upward price trend that began in 1966. As with today, that price rise in the 1960s was preceded by a long period of steady low inflation and low unemployment in the United States.

Like current U.S. President Joe Biden now, then-President Lyndon Johnson initially blamed inflation on microscopic factors in specific industries. The then Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin (William McChesney Martin), partly under pressure from Johnson, was slow to admit that demand was too strong and that public expectations for inflation were out of the anchor direction.

**For the current Fed Chairman Powell, a key challenge currently faces is how to define the current inflation is more like the situation in 1946 or 1966?**

For now, he believes there are some similarities with both of these experiences. In his latest congressional nomination hearing on Tuesday, he attributed inflation to ""strong demand overlaid with supply constraints"" and highlighted the risk that inflation expectations could move away from their anchor direction. The market is now widely expected that the Fed may start raising interest rates as early as March.",1642083992

THINK FOR YOURSELF

Would you willingly allow a certifiable lunatic to come by at least five times a week to tell you that you should feel exactly the way he feels? Would you ever agree to be euphoric just because he is- or miserable just because he thinks you should be? 

Of course not! 

You’d insist on your right to take control of your own emotional life, based on your experiences and your beliefs. 

But, when it comes for their financial lives, millions of people let Mr Market tell them how to feel and what to -despite the obvious fact that, from time to time, he can get nuttier than a fruitcake.

In 1999, when Mr Market was squealing with delight, American employees directed a average of 8.6% of their paychecks into their 401(k) retirement plans. By 2002, after Mr Market had spent three years stuff stocks into black garbage bags, the average contribution rate had dropped by nearly one-quarter, to just 7%. The cheaper stocks got, the less eager people became to buy them-because they were imitating Mr Market, instead of thinking for themselves...”

Goldman Sachs Group strategists believe the situation may not be as dire for the recently battered growth stocks, the Ben Snider-led strategists wrote in a client report.

After a spike in U.S. Treasury yields led to recent heavy losses for growth stocks, only modest further moves in long-term yields are now expected, implying limited further risk to growth stock valuations from discount rates.

Highly valued stocks are off to a poor start this year as the market expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively. Higher rates mean a greater discount to the present value of future profits, hitting the most highly valued growth stocks such as technology companies and boosting lower valued value stocks. Goldman Sachs strategists expect the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, currently around 1.75 percent, to reach 2 percent by the end of the year. While there may be more upside in short-term interest rates, ""the impact on equity valuations will be modest,"" the report said. ""The possibility of slower economic growth in 2022 is a reason to support growth stocks,"" the strategists said, adding that comparisons of the current situation to the turn-of-the-century tech stock bubble may not be entirely appropriate. ""After adjusting for the interest rate environment, growth stock valuations are much lower today than they were in 2000.""

Tudor Jones, Wall Street's 'legendary big man': Many asset classes at risk, commodities severely undervalued

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday local time, legendary Wall Street trader Paul Tudor Jones, who rose to fame with his successful prediction of the October 1987 stock market crash, said that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's battle with inflation will result in multiple asset classes being at risk, and that those assets that performed best during the epidemic The assets that performed best during the epidemic could fall from the top of the mountain to the bottom. Jones remains very bullish on the long-term outlook for U.S. markets compared to others. But right now, valuations are too ""high"" and make him nervous. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will make three or even four rate hikes this year, and Jones warns that the stock market will face heavy difficulties. Jones said commodities appear to be ""severely undervalued"" relative to financial assets, and he expects them to outperform significantly as the tightening cycle unfolds.

As market styles shift toward value stocks, shares of U.S. energy companies continue last year's trend of surging in early 2022, and such stocks are expected to continue their strong performance against the backdrop of U.S. inflation hitting a nearly 40-year high last December. Year-to-date, the U.S. energy sector has gained more than 14%, compared with an overall decline of 0.8% in the S&amp;P 500. Last year, the energy sector led all sectors of the S&amp;P 500, up nearly 48%. The strong performance of the energy sector has been driven by several factors. Brent crude oil has gained about 23% since the beginning of December last year, near its highest level since late 2018. in the first week of 2022, the energy sector outperformed the median of all sectors by 12.2%, the second-best weekly performance of the past decade.

1119,wallstreetbets,Rivian - Why I am doubtful,"*Rivian Automotive*
Market Cap: 76.4B
Employees: 11,000+
Cars Delivered: 920

Daniel Foelber said “Raising an eyebrow or two at Rivian's lofty valuation isn't unwarranted given the company is even more unproven than other up-and-coming EV companies like Lucid Group and Nio. However, one of the reasons why it's best to steer clear of Rivian is that the management team hasn't proven itself on the public stage.”

The company's unproven manufacturing, ability to deliver and service its vehicles, and the unknown cost of its charging network are the single most important reasons why Rivian stock is worth avoiding. Rivian, like Tesla, intends to build its own fast-charging network because it believes it is a necessary service for its remote clients. It remains to be seen how that additional cost will affect the company's profitability. Investors may recall that not long ago, Tesla had a fantastic product but was drowning in a sea of production issues. It's one thing to build a great car. It is a completely different skill to mass produce and deliver it. Given the list of uncertainties and Rivian's exorbitant valuation, there simply isn't a compelling reason to buy the stock today.

Rivian reported a net loss of $426 million in 2019, which increased to $1 billion the following year. The company is expected to invest heavily in product development and expand its manufacturing capabilities, both of which will necessitate significant capital expenditures. Rivian will need to raise capital several times in the future to fund its expansion plans, which will result in shareholder dilution, making it a high-risk bet given the company's sky-high valuations.


*Amazon deal is not binding*
Rivian is backed my Amazon, one of the largest company in the world with over 20% stake in the company. However, Amazon chose to buy from Stellantis, which is trying to tap into market mania for EVs. This would allow the company to catch up with Rivian.
Amazon's purchase of Rivian's vehicles represented the largest purchase of light-duty EVs in history, as part of the tech giant's stated goal of eliminating its carbon footprint by 2040.

However, Amazon, which owns a stake in Rivian, is not required to complete the purchase. When the EV maker filed for its initial public offering (IPO) last August, it stated in regulatory filings that the agreement with the retailer ""does not contain a minimum order quantity or minimum purchase requirements,"" and that purchase orders ""are subject to modification or cancellation upon notice.""

*C level management left in the midst of production ramp up*
Rivian Automotive Inc.'s COO stepped down last month, just as the EV maker was ramping up production for the first time. Rod Copes left the company after holding the position since March 2020. The company said in a statement that Copes “began a phased retirement from Rivian several months ago, affording the team continuity as we moved toward production ramp.” His duties have been distributed across the leadership team, the company said

1147,wallstreetbets,I think the AMC sub is in trouble.,"Full disclosure, I'm a GME ape. I hope just a few people read what I have been noticing about the AMC sub.

I started the journey a year ago, and had hope for everyone and everything. I also saw how some subs got overrun by shills and reverse psychology.
The danger that has been around but keeps growing, is that people are becoming very averse to hearing any negative comments about what is going to happen.

if I had a trustworthy source that told me GME won't moon anytime soon, I'd want to fucking listen. This is about MY money. MY investment, MY future. so i'm all ears. I'd rather hear the darkest shit about my investment, than to keep blindly spamming ""HODL MOASS SOON BANANA IN ANUS TIT JACK KENY FUKT"". 

the problem is, that some people who might have legit concerns are trying to warn others who will completely rip their anus once they have no way back towards gains. there are so many people involved with this, and so much psychology is involved too.

There are people who have very good intentions and have been around for a long time, but who have been conditioned to dismiss, and even FIGHT some arguments with a passion, just because it doesn't align with their past theories. just because they saw someone claim ""hey get out of here with that fud"", and concluded that it was all manipulation. People are in danger, and their money is in danger too. If you're one of those guys blindly spamming ""FUD"" to any argument that is against your stock mooning, shove a dick in your ass and rethink your entire life. What the fuck are you doing? You're becoming a cogwheel in the machine of manipulation to the advantage of your enemies. 

if your CEO sold all his stock, and IF it was a bad thing, why can't you evaluate the consequences anymore? why do you keep thinking everything is good? because some random dude says ""our silverback got his deserved money, we primed for moass now"". Like.. what the fuck? 

I can be wrong, and I want to be wrong. because that's when I learn shit. I WANT to see the bad stuff. because I want to be prepared of what i'm about to fucking lose. Try to take off your blindfolds and be open to discussion. Not everyone is trying to attack or hate on your stonk. Not everyone is coming from SupahStonk to mess with you.

The goal is to adapt, just like our enemies adapt. they have the smartest fucking guys hired, specifically to screw us over. they have control over politics, markets, companies, and even your thoughts. because where do those thoughts come from? Retarded reddittors in isolated echochambers that is your sub.

So.

Take off your eyemasks.
Expose yourself to new information, and be open to discuss it. 
Someone hating on your stock? ask WHY. is this guy legit? can I verify that information myself? Why is the next guy calling him a superstenk shill? What do ""gme shills"" have to benefit from you guys starting to hate them? what do they have to benefit from you selling your stock? why would they want division?

Ape help ape. Wake up. tell me if I'm wrong and stop the braindead ""amc2themoon #AAsilverback #treytrades dm mrbeast moass is coming"". I bet this is mostly paid shills that want to water down the real DD and truth. Do it for your future.",1642077723

1177,wallstreetbets,Looking for other Traders,"Hello my name is Matthes. First of all, I want to say sorry for my English, it’s for sure not the best. My Native Language is German. Before I tell you all why I am here, let me say a few things about me. Im 19 Years old and since 2019 I am trying to learn everything about financial markets, especially about the Stockmarket. Im obsessed since the first day. All day long I think of that. Im not only interested in trading, I like to explore how financial markets works and also how the economy works…! 

Since the beginning of 2020 I trade with real money. That last year was a hell of a year, I was up 5k then back to zero, then again up 7k and down to -5k . I ended last year with a profit of 3k. But that 3k are nothing compare to the time I had spend in front of the monitor. Countless Hours, some you might feel that. So at Oct. - Nov. last year, I had refreshed myself, thought and learning much more about me and trading. Since then my trading was becoming much better and I was able to make constantly profit, till this day. Im now up 12k since the very beginning. As you can imagine I am now feeling way better then last year. The Problem, why I was not able to make money last year, was not that I don’t had an strategy or not the right knowledge. I would say I have a pretty good knowledge. The Problem was that I was never in a situation where I had to control my emotions like that. Long story short, I started gambling on the market. 

Now a very short description about my trading, just that you can get a imagination. Im trading stock and commodity futures. Im a swing trader, sometimes I trade the opening when there is a nice setup. My Main Indicators are the VWAP with three Dev. Bands and the RSI. For sure, I also use Price Action to look for supply and demand areas. I combine price action, technical indicators and fundamental datas to get areas where much signals are coming together. Maybe you understand what I mean. But like I say it is a very short description. 

So why I am here? The thing is, I need other people to connect with. In times of Gamestop and Shitcoins it’s hard to find some peoples in real life, that are taking investing and trading serious.

I want to find people, which I can talk to about trading and not about TikTok. Maybe we can build up a little group where we can exchange trading ideas and knowledge. But also finally met people where we feel good to be with. Even I don’t want to admit it but I think im looking for some friends here hahaha. After this Summer or at the beginning of the next year I want to travel the world, maybe we can meet up. If you are interested to connect with me, please text me.

Best Regards",1642071186

I was looking at Open Door compared with Zillow because they are both online mortgage companies operating throughout the country. Zillow has recently been driving up home prices in Phoenix, while Opendoor is also based in Arizona. 

&amp;#x200B;

Market Cap for Zillow is $14.4 Billion while for Opendoor it is $7.7 Billion

&amp;#x200B;

These online companies are paving the way through faster services for appraisal and home selling. In 2021 the U.S. housing market reached their highest sales in 15 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both these companies also buy and sell homes directly cutting out the middleman. 

&amp;#x200B;

Opendoor was up 6.3% yesterday and I think it is still undervalued and that it is a good short-mid  term inflation play and I am leaning towards the underdog due to it's price and relative value. Zillow however also has a lot of potential as the big money is still buying into the housing market

Then started a heavy and systematic battering by market makers and the stock price is now close to $6.00.

One might wonder why? Well, the max pain level for Friday is $6.00 (level where bankers make most of the money). However more importantly the level on 21st of Jan is $5.00 and there are over **$1 billion** worth of ape money to be burned as those calls were opened during the meme hype in Jan 2021. Every cent closer to $5.00 makes more money to banks.

Why was $NOK part of the four main meme stocks? (BANG = BB, AMC, Nokia and GME)  
The reason is that Keith Gill alias u/deepfuckingvalue saw it as a potentially undervalued stock ([pic of his notebook in WSJ article](https://ibb.co/j6FFqG6)). He truly is a value investor and the hype was a consequence of huge amount of degenerates following him. Many stocks made a short squeeze but for Nokia it was more like a gamma squeeze and actually returning to a reasonable valuation level. Price doubled in one day with massive 1.2 billion volume (share count high but market value low compared to peers in telecom sector).

So, the share price for $NOK was around $4.00 last year January and now it's over $6.00. It's fair to say that DFV was right. Nokia has been making a great turnaround and future looks bright.

More or less this post is just a heads up for all value investor as the stock is currently battered and sold in my opinion with discounted price (Naked shorts based shares dumped to the market?). Make your own DD and buy if you see the potential (I'm not financial advisor).

Meanwhile it seems clear that market makers will maximize their profit and make some of you poor (personally I don't have any of those options but I feel you). Long-term investors will most likely focus on 3rd of Feb when Nokia will announce their plan to revive dividends and give future outlook. Company has a huge net cash, strong cashflow, second to none products in the industry and it's main competitor Chinese Huawei is suffering from US ban so despite of the short term headwinds caused by market manipulation the future seems promising.",1642066011

1211,wallstreetbets,Why Saudi's PIF will inevitably have to buy more Lucid shares (and won't sell LCID upon lockup expiration),"We are just a week away from the second Lucid lockup expiration and I have received lots of emails and messages inquiring about PIF sell off. For PIF, controlling interest (having majority ownership) matters way more than incidental immaterial small financial gains. In this post I am showing why PIF will inevitably have to buy more Lucid shares instead of selling, and the sooner they do it the cheaper it will be for them. Let’s look at the ownership structure immediately after July IPO

&amp;#x200B;

[Share ownership structure as of July 25, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/dqqmf59a5fb81.jpg?width=811&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=602378b3c14f59778de32b3ccbcb0b1f81950299)

  

However, since July lots of things have changed (and PIF stake has been diluted). The following has been added to the float

\- 41,400,000 public warrants were redeemed cashless (0.4458 conversion, **assuming\*** all warrants have been redeemed cashless, 18,456,120 shares have been added to the float)

\- 44,350,000 private placement warrants have been redeemed for cash (**assuming\*** they were all redeemed for cash, evident by cash on Balance sheet as of 9/30/2021, estimated 44,350,000 have been added to the float, however 14,283,333 of it is locked due to clawback clauses)

\- Lucid convertible notes maturing in Dec 2026 in the amount of $2,012,500,000 implies 36,737,861 shares will be issued in Dec 2026 ONLY and ONLY IF (**assuming\***) the company decides to pay back the debtholders all with shares.

\- 68,121,210 stock options could be issued during the next several years (**assuming\*** all will be issued)

\- 43,409,870 RSUs could be issued during the next several years (**assuming\*** all will be issued)

**\*Please note that I made several assumptions which might or might not be true or materialize in the future**.

Just add all above (211,075,061 shares) and you will see that if they are added to the total outstanding shares of 1,618,621,534 shares, the PIF ownership percentage is naturally on track to shrink to 55% in the next few years (vs. 62.7% in July 2021). Lucid is in a very capital-intensive business and will definitely need further rounds of capital raising during the next 3-4 years, which could be in the form of equity offering (another assumption) and those offering will dilute PIF further, bringing their ownership percentage closer to \[or even below\] 50%. Since they will definitely need to have a controlling interest in Lucid, they will inevitably have to either take part in all of the future equity offerings (which will definitely come at a much higher valuation), OR, they need to beef up their ownership and buy more stocks NOW while the stock is still cheap (relative to what it could be in 2023, 2024, 2025 or any future year that the offering might come). This implies that Saudi PIF with its massive $800B reserves (which is growing so fast due to high oil price) must increase their ownership today and buy more of Lucid stocks to eliminate any remote chance of losing their controlling interest in the future, or they will have to pay way more in the future to keep their controlling interest. For the reason above, not only PIF will not sell any shares after lock-up expiration, but they will likely buy (if they haven’t already) more shares.

However, this doesn’t mean that there will be no sellers upon lock-up expiration. By reading Lucid S-1 we figure out series A, series B and series C investors own more than 112M shares combined (Saudis were Series D &amp; Series E investors who made arrangement that Lucid buys back most of series C investors when Saudis invested in Series D, another sign that from those early days Saudis were thinking about establishing a controlling interest, and another implication that Saudis might buy early investors’ shares off-exchange during the next few days). Early founders and non-senior managers &amp; employees and executives also own over 30M shares. Any of these individuals or early investors might sell their shares after lock-up expiration and if they do all at once on Jan 20th, it makes a set up similar to Sep 1 sell off. Let’s review what happened on Sep 1 and compare the situation with today. 

During the last 5 days of August, Lucid stock fell from $22.83 to $19.96 (-12.5%) before falling from $19.96 to $16.12 (-19%) premarket on September 1 on 60M volume, however the stock bounced back off of lows and closed the day at $17.80 on massive 149M daily volume (15x average daily volume compared to August). It took the stock 3 days to fully recover the 19% dip. Prior to the lock up expiration, 42M short interest (with 143% borrowing fee) existed on 207M \[CCIV shareholders\] float (42M /207M = 20% of the float was shorted). The PIPE owned 153.33M shares (excluding PIF’s 13.3M shares), the daily volume was 149M on Sep 1 and 60M of it was premarket (So 60M PIPE sell off happened pre-market! Of course it implies big buyers also bought 60M shares pre-market). The options market during the last 5 days leading to Sep 1 was also interesting. The put option open interests were lower than call options open interest and put premiums were lower than call premiums for September 3 expiration. 

Back to today, there are a few similarities and a few differences. The float today consists of the following shares:

&amp;#x200B;

[Free Float as of Dec 31, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/r284p9px5fb81.jpg?width=783&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a7f9404ca720566b70ca1a75cf98e82ca5f8aab)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Please note the reduction in daily volume following the large purchase of shares by mutual funds and ETFs that passively track Nasdaq (Nasdaq inclusion)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily volume before and after Dec 17, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/lcpig8pe6fb81.jpg?width=821&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cda5752d493d03a6cfd662ff2ce92e188eac361)

  

The short interest (as of 12/31/2021) is 90M shares (107% borrowing fee as of 1/12/2022), so on the float of 408.8M, it is 22% of the float (90M/408.8M) and on the free float of 340M, it is close to 26.5% (90M/340M), this implies that short interest relative to the free float is 30% higher than late August. This implies that there is a much bigger betting against Lucid this time. 

The number of shares susceptible to sell off is 168M (early investors, founders and non-executive employees), which is higher than the 153M in September. It is impossible to predict what % of those 168M will sell, but PIPE investors bought the shares for $15 and sold them as soon as they could on Sep 1 for very tiny gains (they waited 7 months). Early investors and founders who gain the ability to sell on Jan 20 have bought the shares for single digits and they have waited several years and the stock price is way higher than September. Judgment is up to the reader whether they are more likely or less likely to sell. Assuming these investors sell all their shares on Jan 20 (starting premarket and continuing through out the day) and assuming the stock price close at $45 on Jan 19th, we should expect a similar 20% dip in the stock (to $35 - $36) on January 20th. Even if this scenario happens, I expect a sharp rebound to +$50 during the week of January 24 

Unlike Sep 3 option market, the option market for Jan 21 shows that put options are more expensive than call options and open interest on put options is larger than open interest on call options.

Unlike the last 2 weeks leading to Sep 1 when the stock price was under pressure, the stock price trend has been upward during the last 2 weeks leading to Jan 19. 

It is not deniable that the bet against Lucid stock is massive, evident by 90M short interest ($4B bet), but it is also important to emphasize that if the sell off doesn’t materialize according to short sellers’ expectations, the melt up is going to be spectacular. 

Few strategies to ride the event through options market (depending on short-term bullish view or short-term bearish view):

**Short term Bearish view:** 

\- If you have any shares with cost basis above $35, you may buy protective put options for strikes between $35 and $45 for January 21st to protect your gains. Concurrently you may sell cash-secured put options for strikes between $30 - $35 to help off-set the cost of the put options you buy (or instead buy the shares on the market or through limit order if it dips to $30 - $35 zone)

\- If your cost basis is below $30, you shouldn’t be stressed as much as the investor with cost basis above $35. You may still protect your gains and even buy the shares cheaper through bearish put spread, or you may sit tight on your cash and buy shares with market order when it dips

**Short term** **Bullish view:**

\- If you believe the sell off won’t materialize and shorts will need to cover and buy shares instead and hence the stock will skyrocket, you may buy $45 - $55 strike call options (and still finance a portion of it by selling cash-secured puts if you are truly a stock buyer if it dips)

\- If you believe the rise in stock will be moderate, you may buy $45 - $50 call options and sell $55-$60 \[covered\] call options to offset a portion of the call option you bought (bullish call spread) 

Stay assured that PIF won’t sell any shares. PIF is supposed to pay and build a whole factory in Saudi Arabia’s NEOM CITY for Lucid, so they can start producing cars there. If they sell even a small amount of their shares and lose their controlling interest, they ruin their plans to make Saudi Arabia an EV manufacturing hub in the Middle East (Google NEOM city and the $500B project building it)

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck and stay confident Lucid will win the race in mid-to-long term.

This research was initially prompted by seeing the former Chair, Joint Chiefs of Staff, having given up his lucrative positions on the boards of GM and Sprint, not only working for a not-often-discussed investment company but chairing the board of comparatively rinky-dink little Precinmac. As it turned out, that was the first step on what became a long walk.

1/

ADM Mike Mullen chairs the board of Precinmac. Precinmac is a defense-focused hi-spec parts and components machining company.

Pine Island acquired Precinmac on 1 APR 2020 with two other partners: Bain Capital and Compass Partners. Bain is Mitt Romney's twelve-digit AUM cash firehose. Compass Capital is the product of founder Stephen M. Waters. He has interesting connections to what we see in Pine Island.

Compass Capital's only other major holding is Nautilus Integrated Solutions, a defense-focused hi-spec parts and components machining company. Compass chose VADM John Morgan as President and CEO of NIS. Look them up and Waters and Morgan were directors at the U.S. Naval Institute together c. 2011.

Go further back and Mullen and Morgan were CNO and Deputy CNO together c. 2007. They published the Navy's current strategy ""A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower"" that year.

Now Mullen and Morgan are each boss of a defense manufacturer owned in whole or in part by Compass Capital.

This is the primary loop in Pine Island.

Mike Mullen graduated the Naval Academy in 1968. MajGen Charles Bolden, a Pine Island partner, is a classmate of the same graduating year.

LtGen Vincent Stewart was Director of the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity for most of the time Mike Mullen was Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. MCIA is an hour down the highway from the Pentagon in Quantico, VA.

Gen Lloyd Austin, a former Pine Island partner, was made Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2009-2010. Mike Mullen appointed him. ""Austin credited the appointment as having jumpstarted his later career, saying: 'People who might not have known Lloyd Austin began to know him.'"" \[Wikipedia\]. Austin is on the board of directors of RTX. So is David Wajsgras, a Pine Island partner.

All the retired flag officers we see, or will see, connected with Pine Island were in the Department of the Navy \[besides former partner Lloyd Austin\], be it the Navy itself or the Marine Corps. All of them know, or probably know, Mike Mullen. Stephen Waters is also ex-Navy, having retired out as a lieutenant.

Stephen Waters is a director on the board of Valero, the TX-based oil corporation.

So is Sen. Don Nickles, a Pine Island partner.

Of the five ex-congressmen partnered with PIPP, all of them were in Congress in at least some position together from 1995 to 2005. Most of them peaked their congressional careers during the 107th and 108th Congresses at the start of the War on Terror, 2001-2005.

Don Nickles was the Senate R. Whip 1996-2003, the #2 Republican. Tom Daschle was the Senate D. Leader 1995-2005, the #1 Democrat and his counterpart.

Daschle is a member of the bipartisan Issue One ReFormers Caucus. So are Dick Gephardt and Byron Dorgan. Additionally, Dick Gephardt is a consultant for global law firm DLA Piper, where Saxby Chambliss is a partner.

These Congressmen's connections in subcommittees, their important Congressional positions, and their post-Congress lobbying and consulting careers are detailed in the attached.

Stephen Waters lives and works around Greenwich, CT, a popular spot for investment firms and hedge funds. Compass Capital itself is in Stamford, CT. Additionally, Stephen Waters graduated the Harvard Business School in 1974, being involved in alumni committees there ever since.

CNH Partners, a hedge fund subsidiary of AQB Capital Management, is ten minutes down I-95 from Compass Capital. Its three principals all have connections to HBS. Todd Pulvino got his AM and Ph.D from HBS, as well as working there as a visiting professor. Rocky Bryant worked in HBS as a research associate. Mark Mitchell was a professor of finance at Harvard. CNH Partners is an institutional holder of PIPP.

Aristeia Capital, a hedge fund, is directly across from CNH Partners, both companies addressed at 1 &amp; 2 Greenwich Plaza, Greenwich, CT respectively. They share a parking lot. The co-chief investment officer of Aristeia, William Techar, graduated from Harvard with a econ BA. Aristeia Capital is an institutional holder of PIPP.

The three co-founders of Aristeia Capital that Techar works for were all ex-managers at UBS prior to founding Aristeia. UBS is an institutional holder of PIPP—twice. Once as UBS AG and once as its Chicago-based affiliate hedge fund UBS O'Connor.

Mike Mullen graduated the Advanced Management Program at HBS in 1991 and has been involved on the board of HBS in the years since. Charles Bolden was selected as a ALI Fellow at HBS in 2009 and attended a summit there in 2014. Vincent Stewart received ""executive training"" (likely the AMP) at HBS.

5/

Michele Flournoy, a Pine Island partner, graduated Harvard with a social studies BA in 1983. Antony Blinken, a former Pine Island partner, graduated Harvard with the same degree in 1984. They founded WestExec Advisors together in 2017.

Flournoy was formerly a director of the Atlantic Council, a think tank and a who's who of the politically influential. Capricia Marshall, a Pine Island partner, is Vice Chair of the Latin America Center Council there.

Capricia Marshall is a member of the board of trustees of the Blair House Restoration Fund in DC. So is Stuart Holliday, a Pine Island partner.

Flournoy, Blinken, and Marshall were all employed in the first Obama administration, 2009-2013.

So all the DC partners of Pine Island are interconnected with each other. (If Group Three seems tenuous to the rest, more will be revealed later.)

When Blinken got chosen to be Secretary of State, the NYT ran an article about ""potential conflicts of interest"" in the Biden administration at Pine Island, focusing on Blinken, Flournoy, and their connection together at WestExec, pointing at WestExec's publicly-disclosed connection with private defense company Shield AI. How interesting of the Democrat rag-in-chief running anything critical at all of the Democrat commander-in-chief. Blinken said he divested himself of Pine Island financial interests and the NYT considered the case closed. Austin got a similar, much quieter, treatment in a later article. Then the media never said anything about it again.

How simple. Two partners, one connection. Remember: the elite stop you from knowing what they really don't want you to know and thinking how they really don't want you to think not with news articles but a wall of absolute silence.

How convenient that WestExec, which doesn't publish the full list of its consulting partners, did make public its association with Shield AI in time for the NYT to cry ""wolf!"" and ""case closed!"" in such close succession.

Not to mention that Blinken as SecState is much less influential as an insider, if insider influence there be, than Lloyd Austin, the SecDef. No mention of Austin's public goodwill to Mike Mullen, a Pine Island partner?

As we can see in the chart, the relationships at Pine Island go much deeper than two Democrats at WestExec. But the NYT knew about all this, right? It's all in easy Google searches, takes a morning to turn up. There is no hidden meaning in the NYT's silence. They never, ever, run an article at their masters' behest. The easiest way to preempt controversy is never, ever to call it against yourself.

7/

Really with Pine Island we see a team of use to a defense major and not much else. Two Raytheon execs (Wasjgras, Austin even if he's ""not"" on the team), a lot of Navy brass (group one), a lot of ex-Congressmen active in defense appropriations, intel, and energy (group two), some Obama/Biden insiders (group three), and a group skilled in business and diplomacy with foreign countries (Marshall, Holliday, Pine Island co-founder Clyde Tuggle).

This is overkill for a company trying to duct tape a gun to a quadrotor even if the WestExec-ShieldAI connection isn't just bait. Likewise for whatever SparkCognition pretends its doing. Their few contracts have been with the Army and Air Force so far, and they've already secured private funding and their own team of much less well-connected former DoD people.

Pine Island has the guns for big contracts both with the US and abroad. Competitive contracts. Defense majors fight over those, not wannabe tech startups. None of the people working at Pine Island has to work for a living right now, but there they are, all working together. If they weren't going to spear a big fish they'd be at home.

Pine Island is either going to pull a major Defense company or build one, given their acquisition of supplier company Precinmac. But the partners are mostly old and retired, and have too short a time outlook to build a corporation from the ground up.

But there are more connections.

At the risk of turning the chart into spagetti, here they are.

Neal Blue became CEO of General Atomics in 1986 after buying the compnay from Chevron. His brother, Linden Blue, became Vice Chair of the Board.

Neal Blue is a member of the International Advisory Board of the Atlantic Council. His brother is a director of the Executive Committee of the Atlantic Council. It should be noted that both brothers have a strong interest in Latin America: they spent the late 50s flying around Latin America writing articles for the American press, they started a banana and cacao plantation in Nicaragua in 1958, and, according to Linden, what became the MQ-1 Predator arose, in part, to the brothers' interest in helping the Contras in Nicaragua in the late 80s. How interesting that Capricia Marshall is the Vice Chair of the Latin America Center Council at the Atlantic Council. And, as previously forgotten, that Mike Mullen is an honorary director there.

Neal is a member of the board of advisors of the Center for a New American Security. Michele Flournoy co-founded it in 2007.

Linden was a director at Raytheon 1982-1984.

Linden married RADM Ronne Froman in 2013. She had been the Senior VP of GA's Energy Group from 2007, and before that the ranking Navy officer in San Diego, 1997-2000. Froman finished her Navy career as Director of Shore Readiness at the Office of the CNO, 2000-2001. The Director of Surface Warfare at the Office of the CNO 1998-2001 was... Mike Mullen. He became a Deputy CNO in 2001.

Linden previously graduated the Advanced Management School at HBS.

General Atomics could have announced a traditional IPO in the time that PIPP has been active. \[General Atomics is certainly not the target for PIPP. However, it would not be surprising if the target had connections to GA.\] But the connection is there.

Additional Stuff.

Bolden once gave a presentation for the Center for American Progress in 2015. Tom Daschle is the Chairman of the CAP. A major donor to the CAP is Goldman Sachs. Dick Gephardt is a consultant at Goldman, and John Thain and Phil Cooper built their careers there.

General Atomics keeps a business campus at Grand Forks, ND. GA more than tripled its presence there in 2018, the year Pine Island (Capital, not PIPP) was founded. The line from UND in Grand Forks to NDSU in Fargo is the Red River Valley Research Corridor, focusing on hosting tech companies. The federal money to found the Corridor was earmarked by a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee decades ago... Byron Dorgan.

Pine Island, FL lies across the water from John Thain's house on North Captiva Island.

Dorgan is Co-chair of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Energy Project. Tom Daschle co-founded the BPC in 2007.

John Thain got his MBA in 1979 from... the Harvard Business School. Pine Island partner Wm. Russell Mann got his Ph.D in mathematics from Harvard.

Wajsgras is a director at Martin Marietta, where Dorgan had his first job out of college.

Harvard is mentioned, but the next-common runners-up in school connections are Yale and UV. Several of the members have connections to separate schools, institutions, and businesses located in Boston - Waters, Cooper, Bridge, Knox.",1642051332

1281,wallstreetbets,$Wish 2022 Full Analysis Reversal Play 💎,"First of all it's not a financial advice so please do your own DD before investing on anything and only invest the amount you are fully prepared to loose! Also if you are a conservative investor, Index fund is far far better and if you are a value investor, there are ton of opportunities out there and always will be. This is a growth bet !
I am long WISH and I might be little biased; however I am in it to make money so I heartily welcome all LONG BEAR points; not short. Short terms are mostly driven by events and not business fundamentals so WISH could go to $2 if people do not like the new CEO for example ! There is no limit how much low a stock can go unfortunately; please go read Peter Lynch. If you are trying to time the market, good luck!! Also if you are a day trader, good luck to you as well !! - I recently read a post from fellow investor who turned over $28 million in a year and was in negative $7600 :) I personally think it's not worth the time and emotional well being.
What I have learned during my 5 years investing journey is that stocks mostly move up and down driven by sentiment; it comes down to demand and supply - if people are willing to sell for less OR if there are less buyers than sellers, price moves down. These are mostly driven by `catalysts` - a positive/negative earnings, black/white swan events, macro events or even a PR ! But these moves do not usually last long so unless you are trying to time the market, its very difficult to win most of the time.
I would mostly like to focus on two things on this DD - why WISH is down? and if it can recover.
​
Why WISH is down so much?
Sector rotation:
The short answer is sector rotation - BIG money going elsewhere. It's just not WISH, the whole growth small cap sector is down big time. And there are some add-ons to it - SPAC/new IPOs are further down, e-commerce sector is further down, growth are hammered, companies having China ties are further down. Just look at one year chart of these companies for example - STNE (Warren buffet is an investor), BABA (Charlie Munger), CLOV/OPEN (Chamath); TDOC, CRSP (Cathie Wood) even PayPal and SQ are down big time. Remember February last year? It doesn't take much time to move them back up if BIG money flows back in :)
​
Macro events:
Chinese govt crackdown on tech companies- BABA, DIDI,BAIDU and whole Chinese tech. This negatively effected WISH as well.
Reopening of economy drove consumers to stores and it made the 2nd quarter look bad. All e-commerce revenue is down including ETSY and AMZN not just WISH.
Apple changed privacy policy and it had huge impact on Ad spending (it impacted many growth companies who relied on Ad spending to procure customers) - price went up 2-3 times.
Supply chain issues - specifically goods coming out of China.
Inflation and rising interest fear in the market though it shouldn't effect WISH as it has no debt.
​
Other WISH specific catalysts:
CFO's departure
BIG investors exit
Slow down (pause) of growth and MAUs down
CEO's leaving
Down trend causing price to go further down - sentiment, margin call, tax harvesting and few others.
Meme tag
​
And finally some noise:
Negative short articles all over (by shorts)
Lawsuits (mostly fake)
High short selling (by short term traders)
Insiders selling (no real selling - almost all of them are for tax purpose to cover RSU)
​
Now, can WISH recover?
Absolutely ! Go look at NIO, ETSY, TSLA, AMD and even AMZN - you can find many. It may take some time since there are ton of attractive companies to invest in right now - let's just take BABA for example; I believe it should be trading at 3x today. But I am staying put at WISH because I believe BABA can't 10x and WISH has that potential. Here's why:
​
Has been built over a period of decade and over $2 billion has been invested in the business (including advertisings) before IPO money. Go look at CrunchBase - there were many rounds of investing and many investors invested over $5b valuation level before 2015. As everybody knows WISH was offered by AMZN and BABA $10 billion in 2015.
500 million plus downloads in Google play store with about 14 millions over 4 star reviews! Over 2.4 million positive reviews on Apple Store, top 5 e-commerce global platform in many countries - Can you believe it? $1 billion enterprise value with $1.2 billion hard cash? Compare that to Aliexpress and other e-commerce platform.
Came from IPO and not SPAC route. When companies go for IPO, due diligence/valuation is little strict compared to SPAC deals as the Banks have to underwrite. It was valued at $24 a share. At the time JPMC and few others have $30 PT for 2021. Business has actually improved a lot since then if we forget growth for a min which is proportionate to Ad spending.
Is a global e-commerce platform and not US only like ETSY, Wayfair, Overstock etc.. It's not cheap to build a global e-commerce platform so there is a significant barrier of entry.
Has its own business segment that no US/Western company has - serving low to middle class value seeking customer base. Since it is global, it has huge potential to penetrate into India, Brazil and African markets as well. Look at Flipcart (India), MercadoLibre (brazil), Jumia (africa) - WISH do not need to win anywhere, just a small slice of cake is more than enough to increase revenue significantly!
Has now built its own logistics business - $1 billion revenue is not a joke! Imagine small merchants being able to ship worldwide effortlessly! Most of the third world countries have copyright issues/fake product issues - they are willing to spend higher if they can buy authentic Nike shoes for example.
Has $1.2 billion in cash and no debt. Over the period of last 6 months I have investigated many companies and I haven't seen any companies in WISH's size to have that much money with no debt AND this level of Revenue ! Inflation and rising interest rates are no problem for WISH. I've read people's concerned about cash burn, but that's going to be stabilized starting this quarter. $1 billion is a lot of money to spend for growth! It can even buy small companies to diversify its business, invest in new technology and even buy it's own share (its highly unlikely for growth companies though). WISH actually has already been working on WISH clips, live shopping and new influencer led businesses. I believe 1Sansome has potential to be a billion dollar business in no time ! Go look at SHEIN -I encourage people to compare SHEIN and 1Sansome website. SHEIN is now a $10 billion dollar business.
Social commerce that WISH is heading into is already more than a $1T business. - https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/social-commerce-the-next-wave-in-online-shopping/
Is promptly acting to align/fix it's business - revamping it's website, introducing video clips/live shopping, fixing merchant/product quality issues, improving shipping time and potentially getting into new business segments - fintech, payment processing, trend shopping etc.
Got the best management in place now. Forget Peter - he was an engineer and not a business person. Google was actually run by Eric Schdmit and was brought in by the founders Surgery and Larry. I recognize the charm about founder led companies but he still does own about 20% of the business so he is vested. In fact, he is the one who brought Jackie in. Peter has become millionaire from billionaire so he has the most vested interest in WISH than any of us! and I encourage people to go read Jackie's employment terms - her major compensation starts when the WISH stock reaches $30! Also most of the higher management is paid in RSU so its in their interest to make the company successful and remain with WISH.
Has the most cost efficient business model - It doesn't need investment in physical warehouse -WISH Local is now just paused but it has huge potential. It's employee efficiency is highest in the industry - just about 1,000 people running the company VS SHEIN with 10,000 employees !
Rising Ad costs are effecting every e-commerce growth companies but WISH's Ad campaign is the most efficient of most of them. In fact Facebook offered $20 million for its Ad algorithm very early on. I've read many posts that WISH Ad campaign is one of the most efficient campaign in Facebook so it would fare better and can remain competitive. They got the best Data science team - look at their patents! It's a data science / AI company as well.
Even though WISH's revenue is decreased and MAU's have decreased, it's still very significant - go compare with ETSY. This quarter is important - if it can become close to EBTDA positive with less Ad spending and still manages to maintain 40M active users and about 1.5B revenue, it's already a lot ! I do not see any issues doubling the revenue if WISH can make those customers happy and increase their LTV - 40 millions of `active` customers are a lot of customers.
Major competitor is Aliexpress but go try buying something from there and try to return an item or settle an issue! You have to deal with the seller first. WISH no question asked - you even keep your item. Also WISH is growing its merchant base all the world - about 50% are now US based.
E-commerce segment is growing fast and would pass $8 trillion by 2025. With fast delivery and last mile delivery solved, traditional competitors like dollar general, five below and even Macy's JCPenny and most will be wiped out or wouldn't be able to compete. WISH should benefit.
​
Common perceptions:
Selling Chinese products =&gt; It's not even a point - more than 90% products sold all over the world are from China and it's for a reason - its most cheaper to manufacture products there. Most items Amazon sells are made in China. But the point is WISH is trying to create/promote Chinese brands - Assume a Chinese shoes brand that compares with Nike but half the cost.
Selling dildos =&gt; Sex toys are billions of dollar business. I don't see negatives there.
Selling cheap products -=&gt;it's the main business ! Dollar General has $50 billion market cap alone and there are others - dollar tree, five below and even Japanese Daiso.
Selling fraudulent products =&gt; It's not WISH selling them, its the sellers. Could you not post anything on facebook marketplace? I am not saying it's not an issue and I think WISH is working hard to discourage/minimize those sellings.
Float too high for short squeeze =&gt; Look at Nokia; it went up 80% in one day last year - it has 10 times the float of WISH.
Cash burn =&gt; I would like to point out that companies are not usually upfront about investments. For example google categories them under `New bets`. So investment in 1Sansome for example might be hidden under SG&amp;A ! We do not know what else is out there investment/initiative wise.
France ban =&gt; I take that as positive and it will be solved soon. WISH was already working on to fix quality/merchant issues - https://merchant.wish.com/documentation/api/v3/reference#tag/EU-Product-Compliance
Going to zero =&gt; It may go down further but not going to zero. Only companies with debt are in immediate risk of going bankrupt. $1 billion is more than enough to create few startups.
​
Here are few upcoming catalysts:
New CEO =&gt; Whoever is brought in, his fortune will be tied to WISH. Also whoever it is, it would be far better than Peter business wise.
Fourth Qtr earnings =&gt; Cash burn should stabilize and it should be close to EBTDA positive, if not a surprise profit !
Website revamp =&gt; Hopefully it will fix many issues including having to login ! I also think just a minor fix such as sorting a search results by price, reviews, sales and other metric should drive sales. Right now, I can't sort by specific products that are highest sellers in the category ! Its so dumb :)
Video shopping/Live Streaming =&gt; This is now big in China - look at Pinduoduo and others. Social commerce is the next BIG thing - a next gen QVC.
Potential buyout =&gt; I am personally not interested in buyout but its a possibility if it goes further down.
Wish standard, Wish access, revamped website, quality control, Wish clip and efficient use of marketing dollar should help return to growth.
Also very excited about 1Sansome - I believe its a underdog.
Investors who sold for a loss (tax harvesting) might be returning soon. For example I can't imagine why Jack Morris wouldn't buy back WISH at $3 unless he was not true about his WISH investment before.
I have a feeling we will see Institutional investment reaching back above 80% when the SEC filings come out this quarter. Vanguard now is the 2nd highest investor and its average is about $8.
​
Add-ons:
- If share price doesn't reach at least $17 by March 2023, Jackie gets 0. In order to fully vest her RSU price has to be at least $35. If the buyout occurs, stock price has to be at least $17 in order for her to make any money. Please note she is full time - https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312521159033/d124710dex991.htm

My frustration is that now after this split, playing the options are not going to be as profitable. Currently, let's say TQQQ is at 150, and QQQ goes up 2%, you see a 6% move in TQQQ or a $9 swing which is great. 

Now take TQQQ after this 2:1 split. TQQQ is at 75 and QQQ goes up 2%, the correlating move of 6% in TQQQ is $4.50.

1329,wallstreetbets,Hi first post on Reddit but here we go… I would like to see some honest opinions on the current state of the otc market and without typing stocks you want pumped let’s have a constructive conversation,[removed],1642043389
1330,wallstreetbets,$1500-1747 Price Target for $TSLA using Gordon Growth Model with annualized EBITDA and 100 multiple - With Proof,"Below Proof shows that market is valuing Telsa stock (TSLA) using Gordon Growth Model (E1/(r-g)) with annualized EBITDA for last two quarters, and multiple of 100 and the target for current quarter is between $1500-1800. 

Please note multiple of 100 for Tesla makes sense due to unbelievable growth, noting it has 28% delivery growth, which likely translates to 56% EBITDA growth QoQ as Q2 delivery growth was 20% and EBITDA growth was 41%. Using 33% as conservative EBITDA growth and 56% as aggressive.

Q221 - 2b Annualized 8b = $800 PT 
Q321 - 2.8b Annualized 11.2b=$1120 PT
Conservative
Q421 - 3.75b Annualized 15b=$1500 PT
Aggressive
Q421 - 4.37b Annualized 17.47=$1747 PT

Expecting this to rally to between 1500-1747 before next earnings.

If growth continues at current pace, my estimate is we will be looking at close to $2500 price target by end of 2022. 

So stay excited, as this is modeling the way market is behaving. And that is what really matters. 

Remember Amazon has only 10% growth and has multiple of 64.5, so Tesla with annualized 120% should definitely have 100 or higher multiple.",1642043353

This is China’s plan to bring back didi a Chinese company to their own country, so that their people can get rich and not the Americans. Once didi list in SEHK in March at $5 per share all the Chinese will be buying it up since it’s so cheap mark my words.

1371,wallstreetbets,Why TBT is going to 26$+,"As we know, the economy is starting to pick up pace, employment numbers continue to be strong and we're nearing NAIRU (Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, lowest unemployment rate that can be sustained by the fed without causing inflation). Meanwhile, inflation continues to worry investors. But most of them talk about the impact on equities, thus ignoring the bigger picture. 

The fed has a dual mandate. On one hand, they must provide price stability and achieve maximum employment. These goals don't run against each other in the long-term, but they can in the short-term which is currently the case. At the moment the fed believes inflation will stabilise at a moderate level because fiscal stimulus and supply chain issues stop. But the effects of fiscal policies which were introduced during the pandemic (namely infrastructure bill) will  last for multiple years. There are two reasons for this: 1. There's a well known multiplication effect. 2. The money is spent over multiple years. The effects will be sustained high inflation for the next decade, unless the fed gets ahead of the curve.

To combat inflation, the fed can raise rates. I will not go into the exact mechanism as it's irrelevant for this post. Real yields have never been lower as they're negative rn. the yield for 30y treasuries currently sits at 2% while the 2y is at 0.91%. Last month inflation was 0.5% and higher then expected. If this year inflation stays above 3%, real rates will be negative .25 even if jpowww raises long-term rates by 50% to 3%. The effect of such a rate hike will therefore be unimportant for equities but bond prices will feel the pain: similarly to an option's delta, a bond's sensitivity to yield changes can be measured with its duration. TBT has an expected effective duration of around 37 so if powwow does what everyone says, it should rise by around 33% to 24$. But if people start to realise that inflation will stay for multiple years unless we get positive fucking bond yields, the fed will start to pick up the pace and hike rates by a total of at least 1.25% this year. TBT therefore to 26$+

I decided to shut down my small business I hated what I’d did for a living was born into it (3rd gen) I put on a bunch of weight and was pretty much an alcoholic.

A month later gme blows. I joined Reddit that day and joined Wall Street bets. I loved what you all stood for, how you worked together to understand the market, fight corruption. Took new apes by the hand and tried form help educate, form strategies. I left the sub several months ago to join other sub Reddit that focus on the original mission. Since then I’m proud to say I lost 120 pounds now bulking up. Doubled all my investments this year.

1510,wallstreetbets,The Wall St Mentality,"If algos treat GME and AMC the same, that demonstrates where Wall St's head is at. AMC's enterprise value is more than 2.5x GME, but GME has way better prospects and financial health. Wall St is wrong on GME again because they're not hedged appropriately for its long term business potential. They think the groupthink of apes is a bigger factor behind what moves GME from the this point forward as though the market is just influenced by human behavior rather than business building or destruction. They ignore the biggest factor behind the greatest short squeeze in history: Ryan Cohen.

This is not about a squeeze to infinity, but there's real potential for this thing to compound like Tesla from here. Consider that the gaming and metaverse industries grow faster and have more margin/cash flow potential than autos, insurance, or renewables. Ryan Cohen is not just rejuvenating a retailer. He's building a tech giant. He's poaching from tech giants. He achieved the balance sheet ratios of a tech giant during the squeezes. He has the strategic vision, focus, skin in the game, and conservative financial approach of a tech giant founder. Current tech giants have physical footprints the same size as GameStop or larger. 

Power comes from strategic position. GameStop is not in a powerful position, but Ryan took on this project because he saw the necessary elements and a path to achieve a powerful position. Since then he's been working his ass off for shareholders with this as his sole focus. You didn't see much tangible progress, because the first year was the secretive, big-picture stage. He has promised the market nothing and he will easily over deliver this year. None of this is new information, but it is missing from any Wall St take on GME. They're too busy laughing at apes a year later.

Currently down due to lower demand (presumably omicron played a significant role in putting a pause on import/exports), the BDI as a whole is sitting at a pretty attractive level. If you bring the chart out to 5 years, you’ll see that ~2100 was previously a resistance point multiple times.

1517,wallstreetbets,SAVA TO A 1000 AND THIS IS WHY,"Good news today: the FDA still has NOT halted the P3 trials. And neither they will do so tomorrow or the day after.

Don’t forget: it is true that the FDA usually has 150 - 180 days for providing a FORMAL response to Citizen Petitions. However, having worked for the European Medicine Agency (and a national drug authority in a European Member State) I want to give you some insight, how such petitions are processed.

First and most important: such request, even though they have been often abused to disturb competitors, the content of a CP could concern the safety of patients who are taking this drug after authorisation, but also before authorisation. The important thing is „safety“ here. 

After the formal check whether it is permissible and acceptance of the petition, there is quick first scientific assessment whether there is imminent danger/risk for patients/consumer. If the outcome is there, that that may be the case, more resources if needed are given to that CP and the CP gets higher priority. 

Then there is a dynamic process, which is driven by the data and evidence in the CP, soon it becomes more clear how likely it is that indeed patients are at risk and then the following decision is made, already within a month the latest:

1.) imminent danger: FDA must act quickly 

2) no imminent danger: FDA can make use of the maximum time given to respond to a CP. Whether the FDA indeed will need the maximum time depends on practical things: workload of the respective unit/department and priorities. The time is then used to prepare a draft statement which undergoes internal review (both, scientific and by their legal service). 

The point is the following and is great for SAVA longs and why I added again yesterday 400 shares:

1) the FDA has done long ago their initial assessment and the outcome must have been: the patients in the P3 trials are not at risk.

2) point 2 is evidenced by the fact the FDA did not halt the trials. If there was an imminent safety issue, clinicaltrials.gov is updated quickly (otherwise indeed they are often behind) and study centers must be I formed to stop recruitment. The process recruitment includes enrollment of suitable patient who were found eligible after screening and checking incision and exclusion criteria. A patient enrolled in such a trial gets dosing within 1-2 days after enrollment. This study center must be informed to halt recruitment IF there was a safety concern by the FDA. We can exclude that this has happened.

3) remember: if the CP has merits and patients could be at risk, the FDA cannot wait until day 150 or even 180. Today we have day 115. That tells me with a very high degree of certainty that the FDA has no concerns and that the CP will be dismissed. The longer it takes, the less uncertainty. No way the FDA would make use of 150 days or more if they had seen that the results were manipulated and consequently patients could be at risk as argued by the petitioner.

For us that means: the longer it takes, the more we can relax. But it also means: the more nervous the shorts will become when we are approaching the time the FDA could come up with their response to the CP. We are approaching this time, and that is the reason for all the shorts activity, Twitter attacks, supplements to the CP etc….

I took advantage of these considerations and I added several times now when we are approaching the low 40s. I will do so in January again, if the FDA has not responded by Christmas. Latest in early 2022 the stock price will rise sharply even before the FDA comes out with their statement, because the shorts know of course the truth behind their CP (of course only the big shorts behind the CP, not necessarily the small retailer shorts). So, relax the few remaining trading days in 2022 !",1642026704

Many of you know my history with trading... if not, click on my fucking handle and read up previous retarded posts, mostly loss porn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I offer you the greatest advice. I bought some **$spx 4600** puts this afternoon. You know what to do. The easiest way to profit is to inverse me. So, go ahead and **sell some 4600 puts** or maybe get some **4800 calls,  4900 calls, and maybe even freaking 5000 calls** for the end of Jan. Good luck retards. Hopefully, you enjoy the trade as much as you will enjoy my loss porn that is upcoming. 

As one would expect, they were 15% down exactly 3 minutes after I bought, and somehow the late dump in the last 2 minutes brought me back to **only** 10% down.

1642,wallstreetbets,Minsheng Bank Exposure to Evergrande Debt Could Collapse Chinese Banks and Trigger MOASS,"**TLDR:** The first of many Chinese Banks could be about to fail and this could trigger MOASS.  If Chinese financial instruments are being used by US hedge funds as collateral for highly leveraged shorts in...say...our favorite video game or theater stocks...then the collapse of the Chinese banking system could trigger our much anticipated margin calls.  Considering that the data coming out of China is total horseshit, things could be even worse than they appear in this report.

Link to video on Minsheng Bank here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ud-FETmvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ud-FETmvM)

A report in Bloomberg dated January 11th, based on a Citigroup report from September of 2021 paints a messy picture for China Minsheng Bank.  According to the report, the bank holds at least $20 Billion of high-risk developer debt including that of Evergrande.  This represents 27% of Tier 1 Capital held by the bank.  

Link to Bloomberg Report:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/world-s-worst-performing-bank-lent-billions-to-china-evergrande](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/world-s-worst-performing-bank-lent-billions-to-china-evergrande)

However, things could be much worse for the following reasons:

1. The report is dated September 2021 and is likely based on data from August.  What was considered a low-risk developer in August is almost certainly considered high risk now.  Take Shimao for example.  Just a month ago Shimao had an investment-grade credit rating from Fitch, but today they are on the brink of collapse. So the amount of high-risk debt held by Minsheng has almost certainly increased significantly.
2. The amount of Tier 1 Capital held by Minsheng bank could be a total BS figure. The bank has a history of shady dealings (put a pin in that, we'll circle back) and we've already seen that the data coming out of China can't be trusted.  Think I'm kidding? Consider this...Evergrande has never once reported a quarterly loss.  $300 billion in debt.  No sales. And yet somehow they have always been profitable?  The numbers coming out of china are dogshit!
3. There is no way of knowing just how much off-balance sheet Wealth Management Product Debt Minsheng bank is carrying.  A note issued by Fitch back in August of 2021 estimated that WMP debt at Minsheng amounted to 22% of deposits. Link to Fitch note from August 2021:  [https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/fitch-affirms-minsheng-bank-long-term-idr-at-bb-outlook-stable-31-08-2021](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/fitch-affirms-minsheng-bank-long-term-idr-at-bb-outlook-stable-31-08-2021)

Now consider that Minsheng Bank has a history of abusing China's shadow banking system via off-balance sheet debts known as ""Wealth Management Products.""  These are basically unregulated, secret debt securities that promise ungodly returns that are pawned off on unsuspecting investors as risk-free debt instruments when they're really hot garbage.  Back in 2017, the company was fined and several of it's managers were arrested for defrauding investors of some $440 Million (US) by selling Wealth Management Products that didn't actually exist.  At the time it was estimated that China had some $4 trillion (US) in shadow bank debt.  Today those estimates range from $8-$11 trillion (US).  Since these products don't get reported on bank balance sheets, there is no way to know how much of it is out there!

Link to 2017 Article on Minsheng's Wealth Management Scandal: [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/china-minsheng-shadow-banking.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/china-minsheng-shadow-banking.html)

&amp;#x200B;

If things at Minsheng are as bad as I think they are, then the bank is already on the brink of collapse.  And when you factor in counter-party risk and contagion possibility, the entire Chinese Banking system could be on the brink.  If that happens, we may find out very soon that shady outfits such as Shitadel have been holding this dogshit debt as collateral on their books and it could trigger enough margin calls to launch MOASS.

What if we have only three rate hikes in 2022 or what if we even have only two rate hikes? The market will boom before the end of the year when they decide not to raise rates for one of those already dot plotted moments in time the market is already prepared for

I’m calling over 10% gain in the S&amp;P 500 for 2022 and we are currently down for the year. This buying opportunity is actually just as good if not better than the original Covid hit in my opinion in growth stonks. Some people are going to make bank.

If you tards have any gay bear friends, please teach them how to buy put options and tell them to put their money where their mouth is and short these markets. Teach them how to short individual growth stocks that are already down 50% and 70% and make them buy the puts. Give them the tickers of the losers, give them tutoring on how to start an options brokerage account, nurse them into buying puts based on their own convictions. Fortune favors the convincing tard.

IMO - This is a very dangerous market for bears. The bulls have already been severely wounded - backing the truck up. Buying the dip, selling puts, buying puts in the VIX… 

Let’s go - this is the moment Diamond hands in indebted growth companies shine.

1697,wallstreetbets,I have this crazy feeling that China is lying to us. By not telling the truth,"So China's  ridiculous one child policy started in  1980 and average age of a parent in China is 30(I think).
This means the effect of the time bomb they created will be felt right about now, when the majority of the young parents are born after 1980. Now I know everyone's following Chinese real estate giants like Evergrande and Kaisa brought to it's knees, but this is only a symptom of the problem. The real problem here is there probably aren't enough people to buy the properties. And many will probably inherit homes from their parents. Means the popped bubble in its housing market cannot be handled as a bail-out or ""restructuring"" will just transfer the mess and become a bigger problem. 

From South China Morning Post:
""China had just 12 million babies last year, down from 14.65 million in 2019, marking an 18 per cent decline year on year""
I don't think many understand the significance here. The population problem can't be solved with a snap of a finger. Simply lifting the one child policy isn't enough.

In my view the real indicator of any country's young population is the no. of smartphone sales, which started tanking in Q1 of 2019 itself in [China](https://www.statista.com/statistics/220988/global-smartphone-market-share-by-country/).

I don't think any of the models in the world predict a completely chaotic China. Automation and other solutions can only get you so much. You need young people for an economy to be booming especially one like China which up until now grew on the back of cheap labour and workforce availability. Despite what people think the CCP [can't](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2800PN) walk over the people. Policy changes won't be easy.

1704,wallstreetbets,Hidden $NXTD Gamma Slingshot," 

I’ve been following NXTD for some time based on the congested options chain. NXTD has an interesting technical setup and recently found hidden gamma in the play. Something not immediately obvious. 

On October 18th, the stock underwent a reverse stock split (10:1) where 10 shares of NXTD converted to 1 share of new NXTD. However, the old options landed in purgatory. Looking at the data on Fidelity, the delta and premiums are bizzare looking.

So I wondered, how do I look at these options and how do I account for these in gamma calculations? What I found was significant gamma slingshot potential above the $7.5 strike.

**Start with Option Value**

Options can get screwy for all sorts of reasons, stock split, special dividend, and reverse split. For a stock split, we just adjusted the OI, for special dividend, the strike is adjusted down by the dividend amount, but for reverse split… well, it’s much more complicated.

It would make sense to simply multiply the strike by the split ratio but… in NXTD, they didn’t do that. So what we have are $0.5, $1, $1.5, and $2.5 calls that go from OTM to ITM and puts that go ITM to OTM. If you’re like me, you’re wondering how can this work? Money glitch?

📷

***No glitch, because look at the $0.5 strike. The delta is… 0.0877..? How can this be so ITM with such low delta?***

Let’s start with the basics. On 10/18, The old option OI and strike stayed the same. However, the options communication spells out that the contract delivery changes down to 10 shares. 

That 10 share adjustment compensates for the odd situation of ITM options because it introduces a deficit between contract exercise cost and delivered value. Example:

              I own (1) $0.5 strike call that gets adjusted down to 10 share delivery

              It still costs me $50 to exercise ($0.5 x 100) but I am only delivered 10 shares

              If price is trading at $3 then the actual delivered value is $30 (10 x $3)

The option is ITM but no one would do this. On the other hand, if price trades at or above $5 then the delivered value will exceed the exercise cost. For this reason, these old options operate as if the strike WAS adjusted by 10x. Basically, the $0.5 will behave like a $5 strike option, $1 like $10, etc etc. If we lay out by equivalent strike and divide adjusted OI by 10, we have a call OI like the, including both adjusted and ordinary calls:

📷

**Calculating Options Gamma**

Ok, so the strike is 10x what is listed (for true option value), now we need to look at the net effect on delta. The OI for these contracts did not change; just the number of shares delivered. When accounting for delta, we should use 10 shares not 100 shares. The net delta will then be option delta x 10 shares. Delta is determined based on 10x strike ($0.5 behaves like $5, etc).

Typically want to look at the gamma of an options chain (net delta). How much of the float will be used to hedge as underlying prices rises:

📷

This is a tricky exercise and you might ask, why go through the leg work? Take a look at the chart above and you can see that without these adjusted options, we may miss up to 2.5% of hedging of the float. This is because the adjusted option delta is most influential at $5 and above. It adds gamma much higher than the chain would suggest. 

**Why Does All This Matter?**

These adjusted options provided gamma at higher prices, particularly leading into $6 (70% float delta hedged). It also shifts peak gamma to \~$3.5 instead of sub $3. This may indicate why $3.5 has resistance. Neither MMs nor shorts want this to hit peak gamma. Otherwise, the slingshot peaks at and above this number. 

For this play, the gamma opportunity will likely be driven by bullish OI on the $2, $2.5, and $3 calls. These strikes provide the initial momentum to push price to and through $3.5.

However, there’s another dimension that may help sling this forward also. Shorts have buried this with SI and the CTB is really high. If you look at the CTB, you can see that despite any price action, it has been rising consistently over time indicating increasing strain on the short positions.

📷📷

I calculate an average short cost basis of $3.22 and with a 100% margin requirement, it's possible shorts would liquidate somewhere around $6.44. Looking at the change in short cost basis shows that shorts are drilling into the price despite low cost basis.

📷

A huge gamma ramp, high SI, low short cost basis, and increasing CTB could launch NXTD. I will be looking for activity on the $2, $2.5, and $3 calls (high delta calls) to initiate momentum upward.

TL;DR

* The pre-split options provide gamma at and above $5 that is not immediately obvious. 
* Calculations show actual peak gamma at $3.5 and strong gamma through $6. 
* The pre-split options provide up to 2.5% float hedged.
* High SI and increasing CTB at current prices. Average short cost basis of $3.22.
* Potential to launch price dependent on OI hitting the $2c, $2.5c, and $3c strikes.",1642013960

What made this alarming was that their were some having their ignorance exposed to face natural humility, but this was drowned out eventually by the sheer amount of people that not recognize the clear satire. There weren't even enough people interested in lamenting each individuals ignorance which I KNOW is like the favorite fucking thing to do online for an egregious amount of people.

i suspect we see a run by next week to test the recent high near 483.

from there at 483 we need to see if she is going to rejected or break that white dotted trend line.

On top of the vaccine pipeline, Ocugen works on eye therapeutics for eye diseases which could be incredibly beneficial down the road. 

But back to the covid vaccine; a traditional vaccine (similar in structure to a flu shot) which targets the entire virus, instead of a spike protein like mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna use. We all see the waning efficacy of mRNA vaccines, and I want to share all of this with you all because this vaccine just proved to be efficacious against the Delta and Omicron variants, those results released this morning. Incredible vaccine and it baffles me as to how the FDA hasn’t approved it yet; my intuition says politics and money are the reason but soon enough, it’ll be too much for even them to look over. This vaccine is the ONLY vaccine in the world with data published on ages 2+ which is amazing, and a vaccine like this which is good for children, no serious adverse effects, very long shelf life, and cheap to store/ship, is a great option for us to have in the US. 

About a third of Ocugen’s float is shorted right now, and is number 1 on Fintel’s Short Squeeze List.

1822,wallstreetbets,Tilray is undervalued let this thing goes up,"I started my journey with investing in tilray in November - early December 2021 when the new government from Germany published their ""Koalitionsvertrag"" .
This Koalitionsvertrag it's a sort of contract between the three political parties in the german government SPD , Grüne and FDP.
In this contract it is written that cannabis will be legalized in Germany and it will be sold in controlled shops with certified cannabis.

So now it was November 2021 the contract had been published I expected a huge bullish movement in the cannabis sector but nothing happened.
A german cannabis company has experienced a huge spike during this time Synbiotic SE from 19€ up to 39€ .
And Tilray, aurora and other well established companies in Germany do not made any movement.
Tilray has already a huge market share in Germany in the medical cannabis sector, they even have a cannabis plantation there in Neumünster.

Now another example tilray published on Monday their earnings report I know the EPS and operating costs are still not good.
But the revenue increased to 20% which is a good thing.
The dilution is a bad thing I know .
But to briefly summarise it , it was a quite huge step to move forward.

After publishing this Earnings Report tilray spiked up to 20%.
That was a good sign .

Today on WSB a comment was hyped that cannabis help against COVID-19 / SARS COV 19.
Here you can see the study.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007072/#heading

And do we saw any spike in the market no we don't right now we're down by 3%.

I truly believe in the future of the cannabis sector.
We bulls truly believe in the future of the cannabis sector.

Even though we have good news like Koalitionsvertrag in Germany , good Revenue and this study the market do not respond .
This market is rigged as fuck 

It truly believe in a future in Tilray.
Let this thing fly to moon dear bulls 🚀

1833,wallstreetbets,New Book about WSB coming out!,"Title:  The Revolution That Wasn’t


“From Wall Street Journal columnist Spencer Jakab, the real story of the GameStop squeeze—and the surprising winners of a rigged game.

During one crazy week in January 2021, a motley crew of retail traders on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets forum had seemingly done the impossible—they had brought some of the biggest, richest players on Wall Street to their knees. Their weapon was GameStop, a failing retailer whose shares briefly became the most-traded security on the planet and the subject of intense media coverage.
 
The Revolution That Wasn’t is the riveting story of how the meme stock squeeze unfolded, and of the real architects (and winners) of the GameStop rally. Drawing on his years as a stock analyst at a major bank, Jakab exposes technological and financial innovations such as Robinhood’s habit-forming smartphone app as ploys to get our dollars within the larger story of evolving social and economic pressures. 

The surprising truth? What appeared to be a watershed moment—a revolution that stripped the ultra-powerful hedge funds of their market influence, placing power back in the hands of everyday investors—only tilted the odds further in the house’s favor.
 
Online brokerages love to talk about empowerment and “democratizing finance” while profiting from the mistakes and volatility created by novice investors. In this nuanced analysis, Jakab shines a light on the often-misunderstood profit motives and financial mechanisms to show how this so-called revolution is, on balance, a bonanza for Wall Street. But, Jakab argues, there really is a way for ordinary investors to beat the pros: by refusing to play their game.

 REVIEWS

 
""Ever since the GameStop saga erupted into the headlines in the winter of 2021, we’ve all been waiting for the definitive take. Spencer Jakab’s book is it. No matter how much you think you know about Wall Street, this book will surprise you, infuriate you – and educate you.""

“Delightfully written illustrations of how “free” and gamified trading has contributed to frenzied stock market activity with some serious warnings about the dangers facing retail investors tempted to join the wild party. The saga of GameStop and other meme stocks is revealed with the skill of a thrilling whodunit.""
--Burton G. Malkiel, author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street
 
""The Revolution That Wasn’t is a gripping account of the social movement that took over the investing world in 2020.

I pulled out of $SPY about a month ago when it hit $472/share. Somehow, I timed it perfectly, but I saw an inevitable drop coming. The past two drops SPY support was able to prop it up around $454, but SPY is extremely overvalued, especially considering inflation is at 8% as of the last FED Meeting, and the other fact that essentially 4-8 companies within the ETF is doing the heavy lifting.

Last time a ""bubble"" burst on Wall Street, there was a massive Cripto sell-off. Since a couple weeks back, BC has fallen more than $20,000 per coin--tanking the rest of the cripto market with it.

Personally, if I were you I would keep a strong eye on the market as I think it would be wise to invest in $GME and $AMC. While they have gained the reputation of ""Meme Stocks"" they are the most heavily shorted stocks ever; AMC roughly shorted 100,000,000 shares and GME is short 8,500,000 shares. These shares need to be covered.

Now, as you know, last time a market collapsed taxpayers bailed out Wall Street and they blamed poor people and immigrants while giving themselves bonuses. Then they went on doing the exact same thing that caused the crash.

This time China is going to be the entity to blame. This is due to the Evergrande Crisis and the fact that they are in default. If you don't know this story see link here.

Now, with yesterday's news, we saw that for the first time ever Citadel Security took in an outside investment of $1.15 Billion from Sequoia Capital meaning–what we all know, they need equity to buy out or continue shorting these stocks, hoping retail will sell. While retail has proved time and time again that they won't sell–at least in the masses–it will just make the price of $GME and $AMC go that much higher in the long run when they finally cover.

1845,wallstreetbets,Stop blaming options -- learn how to use them,"As an investor, one of your most important objectives is generating income. Inflation eats away at your cash value, so depositing it in a savings account is out of the question. Index funds are okay if you have a long time horizon and don't need liquidity.

*So, what can you do? You need another revenue stream, and right now, options might be your best bet*.

Many people have misconceptions about trading options. People think that it's too risky -- every other post on this sub seems to be someone who has blown up their account ""because of options."" Or people are skeptical of all the get rich quick types out there claiming to get 10x returns with low investment and no risk. 

***When done correctly and with the proper checks-and-balances in place, options trading can be a great way to generate income.*** There are those who manage to consistently see excellent ROIs trading options while subjecting themselves to relatively low risk (*but never zero-risk like some claim).*

# Quick primer for the uninitiated

The fundamentals of options trading revolve around **Puts** and **Calls**. With a put, you have the right to sell stock at a particular time for a specific price. On the other hand, a call gives you the right to buy the stock at a particular price at a specific time. 

Most people buy stocks hoping the value will increase. Investors, however, will buy puts to reduce the risk of their stock positions declining. *Remember,* ***when stock prices drop, put prices go up and vice-versa***, so constant demand for puts often creates a fear premium.

Call prices don't usually trade at the same high premiums as bearish puts. That's not to say that call prices are bad; in fact, they are generally quite decent. Similar to buying shares, people buy calls hoping that stock prices will go up. There are fewer investors that choose to sell puts, probably because *there is more risk involved with selling puts*.

**You need to sell them!**

Selling options on the stocks in your portfolio, or stocks that you would like to add to your holdings, is a time-tested strategy for increasing your profits and decreasing risk.

When you **sell** puts, you have a chance to buy stocks you like at lower prices. When you **sell** calls, you can collect premium while waiting for your stocks to rise in value. Both of these trades can generate income for you while reducing your risk.

A lot of jargon gets tossed around about options trading, and may seem confusing, but you don't have to know the technical names for every strategy to benefit from them.

Selling a call against a stock is what's known as a **buy-write**, or sometimes it's known as a **covered call** or an **over-write;** they all mean more or less the same thing, which is selling a call on a stock. With a buy-write, you are buying stock while at the same time selling a call. Whereas, for an over-write or covered call, you are selling an option against stock that you already hold. 

Selling puts against a stock position is known as a **cash-secured put**. Likewise, a **naked put** is when you sell a put on a stock that you don't already own.

# Examples of how selling options can generate income

Consider the covered call strategy. With a covered call, you can set a sale price when you first buy a stock. So, let's say that you buy a stock for $100, you could then immediately set the sale price at, say, $250. So, in essence, you would effectively be selling $250 in strike calls against that stock to boost your revenue. ***That is to say that you can generate income even if the stock stays flat at $100****.*

On the flip side, cash-secured puts can be used to generate income while you wait for a desired stock to go down to the price you would like to pay to own it. ***Essentially generating income while you wait for that asset to go on sale.***

The risks associated with selling options comes in when investors fly too close to the sun. This could be using leverage they can't afford to open the positions, or being tempted by higher premiums to choose short expiry dates and near at-the-money strikes. If the contract goes in the money at expiration, you risk getting assigned (having shares called away or margin calls to purchase the shares you're obligated to buy). 

Options trading may not be for everyone, but it also isn't as scary or complicated as many people think. Trading options can be a great way to make a decent amount of revenue while at the same time decreasing your risk on the stock positions that you hold already or would like to hold.",1642003115
1846,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is About to Go Up, Not Down","I don't have 3 hours to write this, so let's put this in point form.  Hopefully you retards will digest it better this way.  

* Inflation is a supply issue, not a demand issue
   * Technology is deflationary for goods (and some services).  Globalization is deflationary for labor.
* COVID has disrupted the supply chain in multiple ways
   * Shutdowns in response to virus in major manufacturing countries (China, Vietnam, most of Asia really)
   * Demand has become more volatile, people don't know how much to produce.  Technology can usually predict how much goods to create months in advance, not possible in this environment.  Technology's deflationary impact thus greatly reduced.
* This has been coupled with increase in supply for some goods
   * Chips, appliances, food (meat, coffee), you name it
   * This would have been highly predictable and supply chains could have efficiently adjusted for this shift in a regular environment.  COVID makes it hard to tell where the demand spikes will hit next.
* Yes, stimulus checks and other COVID relief monetary policy have contributed to this increase in demand, although this impact is winding down

This isn't exactly news.  But this is the base case right now.  The idea is that supply chains are getting back online and the system is returning to normal.  Unfortunately, there is a big wrench about to get thrown into the system.

China.  Or as our boy Donnie calls it, Gina.  Gina is a problem.  That's because China makes up over a quarter of the world's manufacturing output.

Here's why China is about to become a disaster for the next 3 months or more, and why this will completely dummy global supply chains even further.  Jerome Powell can set interest rates @ 20% tomorrow and it won't change the situation in China.

* China targeting 0 COVID strategy
   * China 0 COVID is brutal.  City-wide, sometimes province-wide lockdowns.  Months where you literally cannot leave your house.  
   * There are no exceptions for factory workers.  Hell, half these motherfuckers work at factories.  You don't get 0 COVID by giving out a bunch of exceptions.  
* Omicron has spread in the community in China.  Omicron is quickest spreading illness in human history.
   * Once Omicron is moving, it's impossible to stop
   * There's no way China will be able to control it, even with their measures
* The longer China stays stubborn on 0 COVID, the more the supply chain is going to get FKED.  
   * Olympics are coming, China must hold the line until they end.  That's Feb 20th.  Good luck.
   * China has proven to be relentless in their pursuit of 0 COVID
   * Chinese vaccines are world's worst against Omicron, population is COVID-naive (except those Wuhan mf's)
* China will eventually fail and pivot strategy, but it will take months.  In that time, Omicron will demolish the supply chain in China and thus the globe
* We'll start seeing inflation prints at 10%+
* Short term impact on companies manufacturing pre-dominantly in China = disaster

I saw Ryan Cohen at a Game Stop in NY. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be casual and bother him and ask him for some free shares or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and sarcastically clapping in front of my face.

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen shares of GME in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.”

At first, he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the Shares and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any FTDs” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s how FTDs work. After she scanned each share and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by going on about Customer service and NFTs really loudly until he eventual paid with 30000 copies Battlefield 2042.",1642002958

1862,wallstreetbets,Anatomy of a Squeeze– Gamestop is now Primed for Part 2,"It is ironic that near the anniversary of the run last year, similar conditions (this time with smarter retail) has presented itself again for obscene, life-changing gains in Gamestop through to mid-late February. These conditions present as follows:

**Float Locking**

Hate the cult or love them: the fact of the matter is the retail shareholders for Gamestop have pulled their shares from the lending pool/float through what is known as Direct Registration. Estimates range from 8-17 million share locked; approximately 20-50% free float not available to shorts. ***Such a lock adds fuel to the explosive upside potential not found in other equities.***

We see the affect of this in the Ortex data – short have utilized 80% of available lending (that I last checked). How is that possible, when reported SI is so low? Because you (sorta) need a share to short a share. Illiquidity is high from 1) the Direct Registration seen above and 2) less institutional holding (less share lending). Remind you of another infamous short squeeze, where 40% of the float was locked from a share purchase? These die-hards have provided an unparalleled opportunity.

In response to this – shorts have decided to double down on the entire retail sector. However, the main ETFs to do this are now on the Reg SHO list, aka, they burned their “hidden” source of shorting fuel. So now they can only resort to expensive, expensive puts, which expire &amp; can blow up at any time.

**Price Action:**

Before a squeeze, it’s said there is a “dip before a rip”. But it is true. For the VW squeeze, this playbook occurred: after Porshe announced their share buy, the shorts doubled down to drive price below the Gamma Exposure (the 50% dip before rip). Then they got screwed upon Porsche’s options follow-up. This is the most famous example of many.

The shorts had a decision in December: cover the gamma exposure or short below it, and they chose to short. The consequences? Overall Gamma OI is higher, short exposure is larger, and a more attractive entry price. The can was kicked, but exposure is heightened. ***We are at the 50% drop now***.

**Gamma Ramp**

A key necessity of a squeeze is sustained the price move, in which a gamma ramp is necessary.  Despite the 50% drop, the OI on GME options has increased. ***Which is insane – GME investors are not only strong holders of their shares, but also their options***. ***This Gamma Ramp is more than the liquid float (thanks to the float locking!),*** giving credence that price will continue to rise as shares are needed to delta hedge and/or for covering exercising.

Compare GME to, say, AMC. Despite more options volume, AMC has less OI as a % of both float and shares outstanding. What does that say about options price potential between the two? (Hint: drop AMC you tards).

**Gamma Squeeze**

The next step after Gamma Ramp is the Gamma Squeeze.  A key question is: how do we know that x% of investors will exercise their contracts to hold the gamma exposure and/or cause the Gamma Squeeze from improper hedging? See the bolded statement above – Gamestop holders have a clear intention of holding no matter the situation, shares or options, and this activity I surmise would lean towards a higher % of exercising than expected. The best way to play, and cause maximum price increase, is options 1-3 months out, hold through exposure period, and exercise. Gamestop options holders know this: it forces shares on the lit market to be bought, skyrocketing prices.

What happens after the gamma squeeze? Ideally, shorts will close. However, if nobody is margin called, well… so be it. But if we are at this point successfully, price will be at extreme levels, thousands.

**Forced Buy-Ins**

If you look at the Gamestop chart, even the most autist here can see the quarterly movements on the stock. 7 +/- weeks consolidation, 4 +/- weeks up, 1 +/- week blow-off top (squeeze potential now). We are at the end of the consolidation. And based on the options OI, days to cover, ETF forced buy-ins from FTDs on previous shorts, it is gearing up to be the most explosive cycle since last January, this time, lasting until mid-late Feb. The forced buy-in will run right into the large gamma ramp.

Of course – this is all theory. But what are some signs that it’s coming?

· Short utilization has spiked on Ortex.

· Days to cover is rising, back to January 2021 levels per Ortex. 

· The WSJ’s NFT marketplace plant article – this was supposed to describe random price movement on AH the last week from forced buy-ins due to FTDs, but the problem is, the price had started moving before the article was written, and the nft website for Gamestop has been up since May of last year.

o The NFT marketplace being blanketed as a tool to fund terrorists.

· Citadel getting funding from their butt buddy.

· CNBC advising how to but puts (specific date and strike!) on the XRT ETF.

· CNBC even said themselves nothing systemically has changed to stop a Gamestop situation from happening again.

I submit the argument that no other stock is primed for upside as Gamestop in the coming month(s). It’s in readily available data (some paywalls), not mUh CrImE. Sources available upon request.

**VIR Biotechnology (ticker: VIR) -** developed 'Sotrovimab' COVID-19 treatment and partnered GlaxoSmithKline to manufacture it.

So many things happened within the last two months with **VIR** that didn't respond yet in its share price. And yesterday we've got major announcement at JP Morgan 2022 Healthcare Conference that triggers, confirms a bull thesis ([link](https://investors.vir.bio/static-files/7ecf45fb-6918-4cf8-9a02-b8c12183ca4f)).

I predict that the company will have **at least $3.5 billion** in Sales of a **Sotrovimab**. And will have **$30/share** Cash on a Balance sheet. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Facts

In **Q3 2021** they sold just more than **50,000** doses of a drug at **\~$2100** and received **\~$102M** in revenue. They had contracts of **750,000** doses to deliver in 2022.

**What has changed/What's the buying opportunity?**

1. Omicron hit in December. Covid treatments from **$LLY** and **$REGN** became ineffective against Omicron, leaving the **only working** monoclonal treatment - **VIR's Sotrovimab**
2. Just yesterday [they announced](https://investors.vir.bio/static-files/7ecf45fb-6918-4cf8-9a02-b8c12183ca4f) that they already sold **750,000 doses in 2021** and now have **1,700,000 doses** contract worldwide with most in Q1-Q2 of 2022. Their manufacturing capacity increased so they will produce **2,000,000+ doses just in 1H 2022**. That's a **2.26x** increase from the previously known data!
3. Due to the **huge demand** and **shortage of Sotrovimab** there were also a **lot of concerns** that the company **would be able** to set up **manufacturing**. That concern is **now dismissed**, as they confirmed their manufacturing capacity and delivery dates: For example, **only in the US** the schedule is **300,000** doses in **January**, **450,000** doses **Feb-March** or even more. The estimates were **1M doses** in **Q1**, **1M doses** or more in **Q2**. Due to unknown **demand in Q3-Q4,** there is no guidance.
4. Many countries set Sotrovimab in **their guidances** for treatment just in the last 2 weeks. Meaning more spending/demand in the near term.

# Revenue

The last known contract price was **$2100 per dose** for the  US.

Assuming the 1,700,000 contracts at $2100 - it is **$3.57B in sales** of a drug.

According to the contract with GSK - **72.5%** of the revenue share is in favor of VIR.  So that's \~**2.58B of VIR's share (minus the cost of sales).** Cost of Sales appears to be small:

According to VIR's Q3 [SEC report](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1706431/000095017021003057/vir-20210930.htm) Cost of Sales are :

&gt;In the third quarter, well over 50,000 courses delivered and $102.4M of sotrovimab collaboration revenue recognized  
&gt;  
&gt;The cost of collaboration revenue was $7.8 million.

So: $7.8m from the 102.4M revenue =  **Gross margin is \~93%**.

So, most of the money settles as a profit.

# Analyst estimates

After Q3 we had several Analyst Upgrades:

️Date: 08-12-2021. Recommendation: **Buy**. Analyst: HC Wainwright. PT:**$199**

Date: 21-12-2021. Recommendation: **Buy**. HC Wainwright. PT: **$300**

️Date: 21-12-2021. Recommendation: **Underperform**. Analyst: Robert W Baird  **PT: $36**

️Date: 17-11-2021. Recommendation: **Buy**. Needham &amp; Company LLC. **PT: $79**

&amp;#x200B;

Analyst estimated sales for Q4 were:

|Revenue Estimate|Q4 2021|Q1 2022|FY2022|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Lowest (PT $36)|123.9M|200.62M|279.98M|
|Highest (with target Price of $300)|802.8M|517.27M|1.54B|
|**Today's announcement**|**\~900M (fact)**|**\~1,333M (estimate)**|**no guidance, but calculation gives me: 2,333-5,333M**\*|

&amp;#x200B;

* **Real numbers** have **beaten** even the analyst estimates with a **target price** of **$300**/share.
* FY2022 sales now seem to be **10x-20x** of what the lowest analyst predicted.

\*My estimates are based on: \[ the contract amount (minimum) —production capacity(maximum)\].

&amp;#x200B;

# Not just a Covid company

* This is not a Covid-19 only stock. The Pipeline includes a promising **HIV Vaccine** platform (in partnership with Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation), **HBV treatment**, **Influenza** Vaccine, and of course **Covid monoclonal antibody cocktails**. ([link](https://www.vir.bio/pipeline/)).
* Yesterday they announced many updates &amp; taking forward research and development using cash that they make.
* Credible and experienced CEO &amp; Board Member - [George Scangos](https://www.vir.bio/team/george-scangos-ph-d/), which increased BIOGEN's shareholder value from $5B **to $35B** company from 2010 till 2017.

The demand in latest Covid wave is around 10,000,000 doses. Even after the wave ended the demand will be there. With Sotrovimab's current market share around 11% -&gt; with supply increasing it will be more like 30-40%.
* Sotrovimab might stay here as a Best class drug. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies show effectiveness against Omicron for the Sotrovimab, while others are ineffective. Real-world data confirming the benefit. Scientific evidence that it will be effective against all the next variants([link](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/VIR/vir-biotechnology-announces-new-research-describing-the-structural-4vqvcwpr9obj.html)).

&amp;#x200B;

# The ""Pfizer Pill""(Paxlovid) concern

* The guidelines in the US, UK, Japan, Switzerland, France, Australia, Canada have been updated in late December - Early January. The treatment of high-risk populations will stay with Sotrovimab, not Paxlovid.
* Paxlovid antiviral pills for mild/at home/early use got approved (no real-world data yet, only Phase 2 studies, but a lot of credit nevertheless ). Paxlovid already got a 14 billion contract from US Gov.  Antiviral production cycle is \~8-9 months. So, no supply till June 2022.
* It will take share from monoclonals, but it's all about guidelines. And in many cases, they are in favor of Sotrovimab.

And even with 5x less demand in monoclonal antibodies, Sotrovimab can sell \~1,000,000 doses for many years to come.

&amp;#x200B;

# Summary

The final situation now after the news (11.01.2022):

* 1,700,000 doses x $2100 each in confirmed contracts = **$3.57B with most delivery Q1-Q2 2022.**
* **72.5%** of the revenue share with GSK is in favor of VIR.
* Gross margin \~92-93% (Cost of sales 7%) according to Q3 report
* Delivered 750,000 doses last Q (vs 50,000 in Q3)
* Updated manufacturing speed: 1,000,000 doses / Quarter
* Unknown demand in **Q3-Q4 2022** (up to 2,000,000 doses ???)
* **4.5B** market cap, **$700M** in cash &amp; **$200M** in assets
* **HIV** vaccine (phase1) data pending in partnership with Gates Foundation
* Multiple **HBV** treatment in Phase ½  (I think this pipeline has itself **EV\~2B)**
* Second COVID mAb (VIR-7832) in trials

**Best case scenario**: the demand of mAbs which is around 10,000,000 per year stays here for another year, with Sotrovimab staying best in class drug favored in many country’s guidelines.

**Most probable scenario**: after successful 2022, mAb usage decreases to 2,500,000 in 2023, but Sotrovimab market share increases from 11% now to 40% for next several years, bringing the next 3-4 year sales \~ 1 million doses/year.

**Worst case scenario**: if Covid ends here and now within a half of the year..  you get a company with **4B cash** and a rich pipeline in HBV, experience in antivirals for future pandemics.

1893,wallstreetbets,Impact of behavioural biases on investment decisions,"“The investor’s chief problem – and even his worst enemy – is likely to be himself.” 
~ Benjamin Graham

(mods pls don't ban me already) 

Money and emotions are linked together. According to JP Morgan’s report, behaviour is the single most dominant factor in investor returns. Most individual investors — and even professional ones — will eventually underperform the market, due to irrational behavior

People are only human, and so is their financial decision-making. 

It would be nice if investors and markets moved solely on the basis of fundamentals: and economic and financial analysis of businesses. But at times, investors appear to lack self-control, act irrational, and make decisions based more on personal biases than facts.

Behavioural Finance is a relatively new area of study looking at the relationship between behavioural psychology and finance, and seeks to understand the driving forces behind irrational financial decisions.

Why behavioral finance matters?
According to traditional finance theories, humans are “rational” and make logical decisions. This implies they analyse every aspect and make informed decisions. Behavioural finance argues that people base their investment decisions on emotions and biases, which goes against traditional finance theory.

.Behavioral finance helps to explain the difference between expectations of efficient, rational investor behavior and actual behavior. So, you see, being aware of behavioral investing, your own and others, can help you(investors) save money and look more carefully before leaping into a move.

Therefore, I am conducting a research to study the impact of behavioural biases on investment decisions. This study would help investors to understand market sentiments. reflect on their actions and take decisions accordingly. It would be really appreciated if you fill the questionnaire [given ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsMzD-ODiWXc1OsD9BNopETiz-cXv3hUVm2yYEyA7YC7uvdg/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;flr=0)",1641999691

I could probably list 100 reasons why this is a once in a lifetime opportunity… but I know you have an attention span worse than an ape on cocaine, so I’ll keep it short  


**Intro:**

Flying cars have been a science fiction obsession for almost a century, but no one has figured out how to create them, until now! EVTL has managed to build an affordable flying taxi that runs on electricity!  


https://preview.redd.it/kbdr5wlxo9b81.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93fdae4af4f8661f36008be1f7d30deca9a02126

EVTL is backed by American Airlines, Rolls-Royce, Avolon, Microsoft, Honeywell, and more!

But… but… daddy Elon told me flying cars would be too noisy! FUCK NO! EVTL’s VX4 taxi is over 100X quieter than a helicopter

But… but… isn’t it unaffordable? Wrong again! It will definitely cost a premium, but costs are expected to be in-line with an average taxi once mass production starts  


**Private Transportation:** 

Affordable flying taxis have a huge market opportunity. The private jet market is already worth $15.25 billion dollars just in the US. Now imagine how much a wealthy person will be willing to pay for the convenience of a private jet which can take off and land virtually anywhere, is extremely quiet, and can travel up to 200 miles per hour

Time is the only thing money can’t buy, so wealthy people will spend absurd amounts of money to make traveling faster and more convenient

Additionally, the global ridesharing market is worth $21 billion. If EVTL can get even a small portion of that, they will make insane amounts of money!

&amp;#x200B;

**Emergency Transportation:**

The Ambulance Service market is a $15 BILLION industry in the US. Wealthier people who are injured and need care are basically willing to pay anything for the best service. 

A flying Ambulance which can land anywhere, be quiet, and move fast, could get a large chunk of this high margin market. The XV4 is currently the leading vehicle for this

In addition to this, the XV4 could be used like a faster drone to transport critical medical supplies such as organs

&amp;#x200B;

**Green Energy:**

Battery based electric technology has been improving at a rapid pace, and this is perfect for EVTL's vehicles. Electric flying taxis already make sense because they are much quieter than ICE based ones, but they will also constantly be improving due to how fast battery tech is getting better. EVTL is ahead of the curve, and, with their leadership, it should stay that way

**Final Thoughts:**

Look… if you don’t believe me when I say this is a once in a lifetime investment opportunity, just look at how many high end investors they have from the aerospace industry. People who know way fucking more than both me and you are investing heavily into this company and believe it is the future. That is enough confirmation for me

I don’t understand why.  See I’m only new to this investing shit but my curiosity has got me so deep to trying understand how markets work.

I’ve learned that the bond market is so important but forgotten about by alot of investors. See the treasury yields are still low at around 1.7%. 

Lyn Alden has stated this many times that we are similar times to ww2 where we had short burst of high inflation but bonds didn’t move.
In the 70s bonds went with inflation. So what I’m reading is that bonds actually know when inflation is around- Jeff snider says this over and over and it makes so much sense.

Now this is my opinion of what’s shaping up. Have you noticed that the 2 year and the short end has been rising fast globally . And the long end is rising but not as much. The yield curve is flattening. Is this setting up for a quick inversion? A recession on the horizon? It feels like it everywhere you look and the psychology of workers. 

I think I Powell will come out and shock the whole system. Now the fed has done this so many times in history. For example in the late 1920s 
They have a job and they don’t care about the stock market. 
I know it’s doom and gloom but I’ve done alot of reading and studying on market corrections and  what I’ve learnt is that the fed doesn’t give a shit about the stock market.

It is reported that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on the 11th that the Fed may raise interest rates more times and reduce its balance sheet earlier and faster to deal with the persistent high inflation in the United States. He said that the U.S. inflation rate is now well above the 2% target set by the Fed, which indicates that the U.S. economy no longer needs the support of highly accommodative monetary policy, and the Fed will use its policy tools to stop high inflation from becoming more stubborn.

Wall Street Major Warns: U.S. Stocks May Pullback 10% in Short Term

Tom Lee, former chief equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve's expected rate hike later this year will not end the bull market in U.S. stocks, but investors should be prepared for a 10 percent pullback in stocks in the near term. lee's conclusion is based on an analysis of how the stock market has performed since 1990 each time the Fed has raised Interest rates when the stock market performance analysis. He said.

Rate hikes don't end bull markets, but the market usually pauses around the first rate hike. The stock market is likely doing this because it is adjusting to a shift in the market's view of liquidity and a shift in its view of Federal Reserve policy.

Fidelity International Long China Stocks: Fed Rate Hike Can't Hide Attractive Valuations

Portfolio managers at Fidelity International are optimistic about the 2022 outlook for Chinese equities, which present opportunities with attractive valuations following a past year dominated by regulatory headwinds. However, they say the Fed's tightening monetary policy could put pressure on capital flows into Asia. Fidelity International is confident in the attractiveness of valuations of Chinese companies compared to their global peers, and is particularly bullish on the consumer electronics and building materials sectors.

For Chinese companies listed in the U.S., seeking a dual or secondary listing in Hong Kong would be a potential solution in the face of increasing delisting risks. Asian markets face a liquidity disadvantage, but that could subside as investors begin to shift holdings from U.S. exchanges to Hong Kong.

Bob Michele, head of JPMorgan Chase's fixed-income business, is stockpiling cash as the Federal Reserve embarks on a path of tightening that will kill bond returns. Michele said that as the Fed cuts back on stimulus that provided guarantees for asset prices during the epidemic, money market funds and U.S. Treasuries are among the most liquid assets that are better investment options. In Michele's 'realistic surprise forecast' of five listed with colleague Kelsey Berro, Michele said the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield could rise to 3 percent this year from the current 1.766 percent; the base case 10-year U.S. bond yield range is 1.875 percent to 2.375 percent. The JPMorgan team also expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates four times in 2022, starting in March this year.

I opened my own practice and I enjoy what I do - but the other day I had a spare $5,000.00 and decided to go ahead and trade it. My IG markets account had been closed due to inactivity but my alternate account was still active.

Within seconds of executing my first trade I knew I had fucked up. A few hours later and I found myself in the same trance I had spent years trying to escape. Numbers flashing everywhere, CNBC on in the background and multiple cans of red bull etc. on my desk.

I'm at the point now where I am seriously considering finishing off the cases I've acquired for my firm and go back to trading full-time.  What the fuck should I do?",1641995172

With a record IPO size and a global M&amp;A boom, can bank stocks ride the wave of Q4 results?

(Among them, Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will release their earnings before the market on January 14, Goldman Sachs will release its earnings before the market on January 18, and Morgan Stanley will release its earnings on January 19.)

https://preview.redd.it/g9ajdcxt79b81.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74cb0794778bbf618dab62a351a1815da87521a3

Overall, the performance of large bank stocks in the third quarter was relatively bright, and exceeded market expectations. The main reason for this is twofold. First, trading and investment banking revenues rose sharply, which was more evident in all four bank stocks except Wells Fargo. Second, a record merger and acquisition boom on the profit boost, typical of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.

Morgan Stanley had a strong third quarter, with third-quarter results showing revenue of $14.753 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Revenue growth came from three main components, including investment banking revenue of $2.849 billion, up 67% year-over-year; equity trading revenue of $2.88 billion, up 24% year-over-year, and the wealth management business revenue of $5.94 billion, up 28% year-over-year.

Goldman Sachs' third-quarter earnings growth rate remained at essentially the same level as Morgan Stanley, whose earnings growth was also very explosive. Goldman Sachs' net revenue for the third quarter was $13.61 billion, up 26% year-over-year, mainly due to the big increase in investment banking and trading revenue we mentioned earlier. In particular, investment banking revenue was $3.7 billion, up 88% year-over-year. Investment banking growth benefited from significant increases in net income from financial advisory (record revenue), underwriting and corporate lending.

In contrast, JPMorgan Chase and Citibank's revenue growth was only moderate. Although Citi's revenue declined slightly year-over-year, net income grew 48% year-over-year, exceeding market expectations. The three banks are clearly characterized by a slight increase or decline in revenue, but the performance of net profit brought some surprises to the market.

The third-quarter reports show that JPMorgan Chase and Citibank had revenue of $30.44 billion and $17.83 billion in the third quarter, up 2% and down 1%, respectively, while the two companies' net profits were $11.7 billion and $4.6 billion, up nearly 24% and 48%, respectively, year on year. Looking at Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo's third-quarter revenue fell 2.5% year-over-year to $5.12 billion, but net income rose 59% year-over-year to $5.12 billion.

One of the key reasons JPMorgan Chase beat expectations was its better-than-expected loan losses, which were $1.5 billion higher than expected; provisions were $6.11, the smallest in the past four quarters. This is in addition to booming IPO issuance and M&amp;A activity, which generated lucrative commission income for its investment banking business.

Citi was in a similar position, with investment banking revenue of $1.92 billion in the third quarter, up 39% year-over-year. A record pace of global M&amp;A deals pushed its advisory fees to $539 million, more than triple last year's, while debt underwriting and equity underwriting fees rose 19% and 5%, respectively.

Wells Fargo's profit beat expectations primarily due to the release of $1.7 billion in credit loss provisions, which equated to an additional 30 cents to earnings per share. However, Wells Fargo's net interest income declined 5% year-over-year to $8.91 billion in the third quarter due to weaker demand for new loans and lower outstanding loan balances due to increased early repayments.

**What are the factors to watch in the fourth quarter?**

**1. IPO market is hot, and Q4 equity underwriting business is expected to continue to be strong**

The number of global IPOs and capital raised in Q4 continued the strong momentum of the first three quarters of 2021, which will give a boost to the revenue of equity underwriting business. Global IPO deal volume reached $117 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, a quarterly high since Q4 2010, according to Bloomberg data. The $466 billion in deal volume for the year also far exceeded the record $363 billion set in 2007.

**2. SPAC deals pick up, expected to drive Q4 investment banking business growth**

The SPAC deal market was relatively sluggish in the second and third quarters of 2021, but this dynamic picked up in the fourth quarter. According to Bloomberg data, SPAC deals totaled $35 billion in Q4, beating the $17-19 billion in Q2 and Q3, but still well below the $100 billion in Q1.

Citi, Goldman Sachs, Cantor Fitzgerald, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley rounded out the top five SPAC underwriters by deal volume. Jefferies, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank rounded out the top 10.

https://preview.redd.it/hmesdq8y89b81.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11988d4f81b25c1701066a22b73114dd95c83356

**3. Q4 Investment Grade Bond Issuance Increases, Bond Underwriting Business Expected to Improve**

Strong M&amp;A activity also drove bond market strength, with U.S. corporate bond issuance up 14% year-over-year in Q4, largely due to the strong performance of investment-grade bonds, which grew 25% from Q4 2020, while high-yield bonds fell 20%, dragging down the overall gain.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse are the top 10 underwriters of U.S. investment-grade and high-yield bonds in 2021.

Thomas Sheehan, head of global investment banking at Bank of America, said:- ""The multiplier effect from M&amp;A will be evident in the new year, largely due to the increased corporate financing that companies often need when they make acquisitions."" ""2021 has been a very hot year for M&amp;A activity, equity and leveraged finance, all of which are at record highs.

https://preview.redd.it/h95lqcxz89b81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38786ea5a1558cce4b5c3b0f71c4c100600fc70d

**4. M&amp;A transactions are hot, expected Q4 financial advisory revenue will grow**

In 2021, the global M&amp;A transaction volume exceeded USD 5 trillion for the first time. Compared with the same period of the previous year, the financial advisory revenue in Q4 2021 is likely to continue the growth trend, but the growth of Q4 investment banking revenue is expected to slow down compared with the growth of about 50% in investment investment banking revenue in Q3 as M&amp;A transactions are subject to more stringent regulation.

A stable pipeline and favorable market conditions have been the engines of growth for both the underwriting and financial advisory businesses, both of which will continue to drive Q4 investment banking revenue growth. However, record M&amp;A transactions and IPO activity will become more important earnings growth, which will help drive financial advisory revenue growth.

Goldman Sachs topped the M&amp;A advisory market share for the fifth consecutive year, at 24.1%. JPMorgan Chase had a 21.2 percent market share; Morgan Stanley had 18.3 percent; Bank of America had 12.0 percent; Citigroup had 10.4 percent; and Barclays rose to 8.4 percent, overtaking its European rival Credit Suisse to move into sixth place.

https://imgur.com/a/51K0HuE

Let’s begin:

Shopify “has” substantial growth of book revenue for the last 2 years.
Shopify claims that they have generated 1.12 bln. Revenue in 3Q 2021. They claim that this much revenue was generated by 42 bln. of Gross Merchandise Volume (hereafter - GMV) of all Shopify stores.

*Exhibit from latest 10Q:

“Key performance indicators, which we do not consider to be non-GAAP measures, that we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions include Monthly Recurring Revenue (""MRR"") and Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV""). Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies. The following table shows MRR and GMV for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020...
...Three months ended September 30, Gross Merchandise Volume $ 41,764,997”

There are some companies for comparison 3Q 2021: Coca-Cola with all subsidiaries - 10.4 bln. revenue, Phizer - 24 bln. revenue. Yes, Shopify says that Shopify stores selling yoga equipment or metal straws sold more than two companies from S&amp;P 500 combined.

This can be true: Shopify powers stores of Pepsi Co., Staples, Fenty Beauty, right?

Wrong!
Pepsi does not sell from its website, B2B only, Staples and Fenty Beauty do not have SHOPIFY PAYMENTS checkout meaning they are not part of revenue sharing plan, you can check it yourself.

Why Shopify payments is important? Because it composes 50% of all Shopify revenue or 75% of merchant solutions revenue.

*Exhibit from latest 40F

“Merchant solutions revenues increased $1,084.8 million, or 115.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in merchant solutions revenues was primarily a result of Shopify Payments revenue growing by $835.2 million, or 121.2%, in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.”

Formula: $835.2 /121.2% + $835.2  = 1,524 mln. Payments revenue of 2,021 mln. Merchant solutions revenue in 2020.

So Shopify is now a fintech company? If it is, it has the best equipment in the world that can generate &gt;300x yearly revenue of its book value:

*Exhibit from the latest 40-F

“10. Property and Equipment, December 31, 2020
Computer equipment Net book value $ 9,331”

Or rents the best equipment in the world:

*Exhibit from the latest 10-q

“The components of lease expense were as follows:
Nine months ended September 30, 2021
Operating lease expense 16,041
Variable lease expense, including non-lease components 9,210
Total lease expense 25,251”

Really, it doesn’t. There are 10 000 employees at the moment. It means that IT company has 980 USD of computer equipment per employee. That means that this company only has PC for each employee and probably a couple of old servers for accounting department. That’s it!

The reality is that Shopify payments is a Stripe with Shopify logo on it:

*Exhibit from latest 40F

“We currently rely on a single supplier to provide the technology we offer through Shopify Payments.

At present, we have payment service provider agreements with Stripe, Inc. (""Stripe""), which automatically renew every 12 months, unless either party terminates the agreement earlier upon 180 days' notice. These agreements are integral to Shopify Payments and, at this time, any disruption or problems with Stripe or its services could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial results. We have the ability, under our current agreements, to integrate alternative payment service providers for Shopify Payments. However, if Stripe were to terminate its relationship with us before an alternative payment service provider was fully integrated we could incur substantial delays and expense, and the quality and reliability of such alternative payment service provider may not be comparable.”

The whole responsibility for Shopify payments is on Stripe according to the contact (section 5, it is a bit long, didn’t quote):

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000119312515129273/d863202dex1011.htm

 
Despite that Shopify has no responsibility over payments and has no infrastructure it still recognizes revenue as a principal despite that in reality it is acting as an agent:

*Exhibit from latest 40F:

“The Company follows the guidance provided in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent in arrangements with customers that involve another party that contributes to providing a specified service to a customer. In these instances, the Company determines whether it has promised to provide the specified service itself (as principal) or to arrange for the specified service to be provided by another party (as an agent). This determination depends on the facts and circumstances of each arrangement and, in some instances, involves significant judgment. The Company recognizes revenue from Shopify Shipping, the sales of apps and Shop Pay Installments on a net basis as the Company is not primarily responsible for the fulfillment, does not have control of the promised service, and does not have full discretion in establishing prices and therefore is the agent in the arrangement with merchants. All other revenue is reported on a gross basis, as the Company has determined it is the principal in the arrangement.”

Note that Shop Pay instalments are not Shopify Payments. These are two different products.

Why it is important? (writing like Motley fool, lol, it is because they are publishing bullish article about Shopify every day and I read them).

It is important because even with abuse of Point-of-sale revenue recognition method for Shopify payments Company is still overvalued by PE metric.
And there are two ways to increase profit:   
1. To cut costs – impossible, because all costs are commission of Stripe   
2. To increase revenue – possible.   

This brings us to the thesis why Shopify is Ponzi.
In order to show higher profit Shopify Inc. creates fake stores and makes fake sales from them.
There is a study published in Forbes supporting this statement:  
https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/01/18/analysis-of-124044-shopify-stores-says-25788-are-fraudulent-or-dangerous/?sh=630d5ce73cd5

Revenue from these fake stores is not real but cost of sales (fee of Stripe) is real and Shopify has constant cash outflows from its operations.
It is surviving only by friquent SPOs: Feb 2018, Dec 2018, Sep 2019, May 2020, Sep 2020, Feb 2021 (see 10Q and 40F).

This brings us to the darkest part of fraud.
Shopify gets clear audit opinion. Cash balance is confirmed. Does it mean that if cash flow statement is correct and balance is correct then P&amp;L is correct?
Not neceserally. What is in the cash balance? 71% of cash is marketable securities:

*Exhibit from latest 40-F

“As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $2,703,597 and $649,916, respectively. These balances included $1,927,013 and $423,443, respectively, of money market funds, repurchase agreements, U.S. federal bonds and corporate bonds and commercial paper.”

And there are 2 ways how to get marketable securities:

1 – Buy them with cash 
2 – Buy them on margin  


Shopify got these marketable securities on margin because they don’t have that much cash. Auditors send confirmation request to broker of Shopify and receive an answer with open positions but without margin. Clear audit opinion is in the pocket. In quarterly statements no need for such manipulation because there is no audit. Cash balance can also be used as collateral or Shopify could provide a bank guarantee. There are many ways to get a margin.

One day head of Shopify treasury, Brett O’Grady, sees financial statements and asks the top management why margin is not presented in them (in liabilities section of balance sheet). (This is fine. I am responsible for preparing financial statement at my current work place and the head of treasury is my closest friend. He has never seen FS of our company despite that I send them to all employees of finance department. He doesn’t care because it is not his responsibility). After getting no real answer or answer that Shopify is committing a fraud.  And seeing that it is the reason why 20 executives left the company in the past 2 years:

There is no sign of violence. Bike is in perfect condition. He just disappeared. His father says that it is not in his character. Because there is no body homicide case can’t be open. To clear possible trace and avoid suspicion Shopify hires private investigation firm:

https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/shopify-engages-private-firm-to-support-search-for-executive-reported-missing-in-ottawa-1.5633495

TLDR: Shopify operates under the following scheme:
Create fake stores -&gt; make fictional sales through them -&gt; report revenue growth -&gt; do SPO when Stripe eats all your money -&gt; repeat -&gt; at the end of the year for auditors buy marketable securities on margin and remaining cash to get clean opinion. 

Support it by paying Motley fool to publish a bullish thesis on you every day and spending 500 mln. in a year sales and marketing. 

If there is a risk of Stripe going public and your fraud to be exposed purchase &lt;1% of Stripe for the amount of your yearly R&amp;D budget (400 mln.) It will satisfy Stripe for some time.

Why I performed such investigation on Shopify, what made me target this company? It is pure coincidence driven by my low IQ and dirty pumping. As a true retard I started my play with stocks in 2021. I read Motley fool and bought SHOP myself, it was my first stock. Only after it I read 40F myself and sold it in panic.

2037,wallstreetbets,Inflation 8:30AM ET - My forecast 6.7% to 7% with 6.9% as median. Market expects 7%.,"Hello everyone again!

I posted yesterday on JPow's confirmation hearing [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1f9to/jerome\_powell\_confirmation\_hearing\_live\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1f9to/jerome_powell_confirmation_hearing_live_now/)

Last month I predicted inflation to be within 6.7 to 6.9% (actual 6.8%). [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rd8hu3/inflation\_countdown\_10\_minutes\_830\_et\_my\_guess](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rd8hu3/inflation_countdown_10_minutes_830_et_my_guess)

This month, my analysis shows inflation should be within expectations or even better! My minimum prediction is 6.73% and maximum range is 6.97%. My median prediction is 6.86%. Analysts expect 7%, and last month was 6.8%.

First **Food Away from Home** I used past BLS PDF releases: [https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm#2021](https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm#2021). First note the relative importance for CPI (ie % of basket is for food away from home).

First COVID deaths in December are much lower than last December - last December / Jan / Feb was a horrible time. However with the advent of Omicron, people will buy more food online.

[Google COVID deaths](https://preview.redd.it/oxw7eaye78b81.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13ed9cd57bd28ae9d64a01423c0d5da259011dc1)

https://preview.redd.it/xdycj9ns78b81.png?width=1031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2d4d3b3dbe114beba27d323786715d3402b2845

You can see above my relative importance for food away from home jumps this month from 6.262% to 6.304%. Total quits as per the great resignation / antiwork movements seem to possibly subside this month, since it's generally in a cycling motion - up n down. However with Omicron - it might be more problematic. However, last month you can see a rise in quits (GREEN), and in general food inflation (PURPLE) rises generally in tandem. I suspect November's sudden jump in quit ratio combined with restaurants hiring more to prepare for Omicron will cause food prices after adjusted for relative importance to go up to 0.439% YoY. Previously 0.363% YoY. YoY 6.9%.

https://preview.redd.it/ike882j088b81.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca5f90627919083e453aa1c3d3233089da31fa18

On  **Other Food prices,** I suspect it's very possible companies are purposely passing higher costs to consumers.

https://preview.redd.it/0vtwar9798b81.png?width=393&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=011ad0298e4754485be386e09ca30a6c2c2275f1

It's quote clear above producer prices for pork, poultry, beef seem to have somewhat recovered, except weirdly prices for the consumer are going up. I'm going to assume the trend continues at a 15% slope.

https://preview.redd.it/wgp5t8ed98b81.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c368bfbd7aa497cbba31fafd237c3c4e89d2631a

https://preview.redd.it/wedv43b098b81.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418ef3e8989bfc316aee13ebd5d47c50817d9864

You can see I attributed food minus food away from home inflation after adjusted for relative importance to be around 0.55%. YoY 7.034%.

Next is **Airline Fares.** Multiple sources showcase from 26 December to January 3ish, airlines had to cancel around 10 to 12% of all flights. In fact recently some airlines will permanently cancel 10% of flights due to staffing shortages due to Omicron.

[FlightAware](https://preview.redd.it/b3gymbyt98b81.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11f7416f433d7c07092c3f32959b62e4471a8abb)

However, the number of people going to see family and friends seem to be very high - hence I attributed a jump in relative importance from 0.58 to 0.7. Prices seem to be increased by at least 10% due to cancellations (ie less supply, high demand == higher prices).

https://preview.redd.it/3fpra524a8b81.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e4a8826e6334df95df0675f5fdcc450084e5fe2

I attribute after weighting for relative importance for airfares to contribute a whopping 0.7% increase - which is exceptionally large. YoY 10%.

Onto **rent, shelter** \- the largest chunk normally. Due to Omicron, vacancy rates have been going UP to 4.3% this month from 3.8% in August this year. Uncertainty from COVID caused people to move back to their loved ones to reduce cost, and take care of their family.

[Apartment List](https://preview.redd.it/49xdibuba8b81.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec9f5c897ab4e7dcbb0623ba8d596d851cab2397)

This makes me reduce the relative importance by around 0.04% or so, not much from last month. 

https://preview.redd.it/encdmiyja8b81.png?width=1023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3708aa01e890f534d74f9aff36ec38be7565774

https://preview.redd.it/ftdhndjsa8b81.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=723f13531693336ef7ec5f5ca7e9e7b8998d652c

Above, I showcase the shelter costs in tandem with other graphs. Shelter costs seem to have subsided, however, when compared to December 2020 (which dropped from Nov 2020), presumably no YoY reduction is seen. I place the YoY to be similar to last month's 3.8% albeit higher at 3.85%.

On **used cars**, the Manheim index is useful. Above you can see car prices to go up still in December, albeit at a slower pace.

https://preview.redd.it/ych2bss9b8b81.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88bea37dcb81281e99d4cd7619ade89ab019e8f1

New cars inflation tend to around 37% or so that of old cars. Likewise Manheim says sales seem to be slightly flat, and down YoY. Relative importance will be adjusted to reflect a 1% growth. After adjusting used cars to be 37% and adding new and old cars, we get a 7.262% inflation attribution. YoY old cars 34%. New cars 12.58%.

On **energy prices**.

[EIA](https://preview.redd.it/0s5aq1mxb8b81.png?width=499&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad55c60c23a4189133211bf09fdf7b4d2599b398)

First gas consumption is a proxy for general energy consumption. You can see the seasonality. In Dec 2021, we had somewhat of a cold winter, with some storms and issues. 2020 was unusually warm. 2019 winter. 2018 was blizzard time. So in general, I'm upping the relative importance like that in the blizzard times ie from 7.469 all the way to 7.7%.

https://preview.redd.it/9670lsg8c8b81.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caa8ab41401f6ecbec8b53cf756de318c43fce90

On actual prices, it's quiote clear gas prices have FINALLY dropped after a stubborn increase. Data is sourced from EIA's weekly gas prices. It's quite clear you can see the dip in December. If you layer CPI for energy, you can see a similar trend in general. I believe YoY energy to rise by 26.04%, a drop from last month's 33.51%.

https://preview.redd.it/w1apyvccc8b81.png?width=1153&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=067757ee461311e63af4f429a36bb93dd657d40a

Onto **medicine**. Due to rising COVID, we presume medicine costs to go up due to people buying testing. So relative importance is higher at 7.1 from 7.002. However, if you compare December 2020, COVID was running rampant in the US - deaths skyrocketed. Now, deaths are reduced.

[Google covid deaths](https://preview.redd.it/9yeyesftc8b81.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f7335f3fdf0ac447ffdbf09b20f2ababf747bc9)

By just getting the 52% reduction in deaths compared to December 2020 levels, and multiplying out, we get YoY a 1.468% inflation.

https://preview.redd.it/kt2himuxc8b81.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af98edcc9eacf818623359fc8146fe9108dfb61e

Now if you combine everything:

https://preview.redd.it/k70icx69d8b81.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb94d6ee3ad40cbdd5aef93d3eb5fe50ae77acb3

You will see a relative importance attribution of 69.16% (ie I missed 31% or so of the basket). By looking at past ratios, approx at maximum 15.33% adjustment needs to be made. At best 11.38%.

By adjusting my final guess of 6.044% inflation by these adjustements, we get inflation for December to be at **minimum 6.733%, median 6.86% and at most 6.97%.**

**This means in general, market analyst predictions of 7% seem reasonable, but it's very possible 6.9% or so can be seen - the issue is I'm missing 31% of the other basket.**",1641981948

Today the news about medical marijuana blocking Covid-19 binding to cells came out. This puts the company Tilray, **and the whole sector**, in a whole new game that fits with current events in the world. Due to this I believe we will see 142 usd rather sooner than later. 

Tilray is the only GMP Certified, large international cannabisoperator, that is active in Europe. Couple this news together with the great annual report that hit the market 10th of january, just two days ago.  
There are also other options for this Covid-play you could make: Curaleaf, Truelieve or Verano. But those are strictly operating in the US and have no plans on expanding internationally.

2047,wallstreetbets,What are the Investment Opportunities Among Chinese Stocks in 2022?,"**Looking back at 2021: Under Difficulties**

In 2021, Chinese concept stocks were under difficulties.

From the anti-monopoly at the beginning of the year, to the ""double reduction"" in the middle of the year, to the official implementation of the ""Foreign Company Accountability Act"" at the end of the year, coupled with the game between the two countries, it's like Moon VS Tod when compare Chinese concept stocks which share price has mostly halved with the NASDAQ that have risen 17.78%.

After analyzing the price of Chinese concept stocks, about 80% recorded a decline throughout the year. Among them, more than 40 Chinese concept stocks fell by more than 80% annually, more than 150 companies fell by over 40%, the annual decline of Gaotu reached 96%, the annual decline of TAL was 94%, the cumulative decline of New Oriental was 88.7%, and the cumulative decline of iQiyi was 74%. Pinduoduo has fallen by more than 67%.

Specifically, Alibaba’s total market value evaporated as high as US$320 billion in 2021, and Pinduoduo’s total market value evaporated more than US$147 billion.

In 2021, many US-listed Chinese companies have returned to Hong Kong stocks or A-share. On December 3, 2021, Didi announced that it will start the delisting work on the New York Stock Exchange. It has only been listed on the US stock market for 156 days.

4. Tuesday U.S. oil closed 3.8% higher, the highest closing price in two months

Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said the outlook for global crude demand ""still looks positive as most major economies are getting closer to the other side of the Omicron variant poisonous strain fence.""

He said that if inventories continue to fall, U.S. crude oil climate prices will ""surge to last year's highs.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures for February delivery rose $2.99, or 3.8 percent, to close at $81.22 a barrel, the highest close since Nov. 11, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

5. Gold futures closed 1.1% higher on Tuesday, hitting a near one-week high

Powell said at his re-election hearing that the central bank's plan to raise interest rates should not impact the economy or hurt the job market. Powell was essentially painting a vision of a ""soft landing"" for the economy, not a recession.

Gold Newsletter editor Brien Lundin said, ""While all markets are alarmed by the Fed's shift to more hawkish rhetoric, I think Powell's testimony reassures people that the Fed will not act too aggressively and will keep the economy healthy as a top priority.""

Gold futures for February delivery rose $19.70, or 1.1 percent, to close at $1,818.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Based on the most active contracts, gold futures hit their highest settlement price since Jan. 5 on Tuesday. So far gold futures recorded a third consecutive trading day of gains.

6. Emerging markets outside of China saw a ""sharp brake"" on investment flows

Foreign investors pulled $9.6 billion from bonds in developing countries outside China last December, the largest outflow since the first round of the epidemic hit the market in March 2020, according to data from the International Finance Association.

""We are seeing a de facto sharp brake in non-Chinese emerging markets,"" economist Jonathan Fortun wrote in Tuesday's report. ""The latest omicron variant strain, accelerated Fed tapering and a stronger dollar all pose additional risks to an already strained outlook for emerging market flows.""

Fortun said the situation is very different between China and other emerging markets, as investors are betting that the world's second-largest economy will rebound faster than other regions.

**International Macro**

1. Powell: If further rate hikes are needed to cool inflation, the Fed will do so

Powell said high inflation is a serious threat to hinder full employment, and inflationary pressures could continue into the middle of next year. If inflation lasts longer, which means more entrenched risks, the Fed's policy will respond.

Earlier, Powell said in a speech prepared for Tuesday's nomination confirmation hearing that the Fed is firmly committed to the goal of maximizing employment and price stability and will use tools to support the economy and a strong labor market, and prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.

2. The Fed's senior officials again hawkish voice: another this year's ticket committee to support a rate hike in March

On Tuesday, January 11 EST, a total of three senior Fed officials who have the right to vote at this year's Fed monetary policy meeting FOMC spoke. The Cleveland Fed President Mester (Loretta Mester), who was the first to speak, said that in response to a tight supply labor market and continued high and more general high inflation, the Fed may need to raise interest rates at least three times this year and begin to shrink the table. She said.

Meister said that the final monetary policy decision will depend on the economic situation, as well as how the new crown epidemic changes, but noted that in order to address inflation ""well above"" the Fed's target level, Fed officials may now need to recalibrate policy. Given that inflation is ""well above where we need to be"" and the labor market is tight, ""the Fed is indeed likely to remove some of the accommodation.""

3. The World Bank cut global growth forecast for 2022, the epidemic and weakening financial support are the reasons

Global GDP is likely to grow 4.1 percent this year, down from the 4.3 percent forecast back in June, the Washington-based World Bank said Tuesday in its semiannual Global Economic Prospects report.

""A serious slowdown is happening,"" Ayhan Kose, chief economist at the institution's Prospects Group, said in an interview. The global economy is ""essentially on two different flight lines: advanced economies are flying high; emerging markets and developing economies are somewhat depressed and lagging behind.""

The global outlook is overshadowed by what World Bank President David Malpass called ""exceptional uncertainty. Downside risks include a resurgence of the Covid-19 outbreak, the possibility of runaway inflation expectations and financial pressures amid record debt levels, the bank said. These risks increase the likelihood of a hard economic landing in emerging markets with limited room for supportive policies, the agency said.

4. legislation to prohibit members of Congress from speculating in stocks? Stock God Pelosi is in danger!

U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that if the Republican Party wins the majority of seats in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections in November, and he himself will consider banning members of Congress from holding or trading stocks if he becomes Speaker of the House.

As it stands now, the poor response to the new crown epidemic, high inflation rate, supply chain crisis and other issues have led to Biden's disapproval rate constantly refreshing highs, and the market generally believes that the Democrats will lose control of Congress in the midterm elections.

5. U.S. small business optimism rose, but inflation and lack of qualified labor to become the biggest challenge

""Inflation is at its highest level since the 1980s, with an overwhelming impact on business owners' ability to manage their businesses,"" NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement.

Fifty-seven percent of companies said there were few or no qualified applicants for job openings, down from a record 62 percent in September but well above the average of 41.7 percent since 1993.

6. WHO warns: Omicron could infect more than half of Europeans in a few weeks

At the current rate of transmission, more than half of Europe's population could be infected with omicron within weeks, said Hans Kluge, regional director for Europe at the World Health Organization.

""This fast-spreading variant of the virus is sweeping across the region like a tidal wave from west to east, and most Europeans could be infected with the disease within the next six to eight weeks,"" Kluge said at a briefing Tuesday, commenting on forecast data from the Center for Health Metrics Evaluation and Research.

7. Brazil's 2021 inflation rate hits 6-year high

Brazil's inflation rate in 2021 will be 10.06 percent, a new high since 2015, according to data released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) on 11.

The data show that the level of inflation in Brazil in 2021 is much higher than the 4.52% in 2020. Rising fuel, energy and food prices are the main cause of high inflation in Brazil.

8. JPMorgan Chase U.S. Treasury clients net short ratio reached the highest since December 2017

2. Pfizer Vaccine Partner BioNTech: Revenue from New Crown Vaccine May Decrease This Year

BioNTech said revenue from the new crown vaccine it developed with Pfizer Inc. this year may be lower than last year, with sales expected to be between 13 billion euros and 17 billion euros ($14.7 billion to $19.3 billion), after totaling 16 billion euros to 17 billion euros last year. BioNTech has pledged to use the proceeds to develop cancer drugs and new vaccines.

Pfizer forecast vaccine sales of $31 billion this year last December, based on contracts for 1.9 billion doses signed as of mid-November. Europe and the U.S. are urging people to get booster shots due to a new wave of infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant, although it remains unclear how many countries will get a new round of vaccinations later this year.

3. Facebook asks to dismiss FTC lawsuit, court disagrees

Facebook asked to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC against the company, but a judge denied Facebook's request, finding that the FTC's suit was justified.

The FTC argued that the court should require Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, while Facebook asked Judge James Boasberg of the federal court in Washington, DC, to dismiss the lawsuit.

According to Boasberg, ""Whether the FTC will ultimately be able to give proof and win on summary judgment and at trial is something that everyone is speculating about. The court will not engage in such speculation; we simply believe that at this stage of the motion to strike, the FTC's allegations are deemed true and its claims are reasonable.""

2065,wallstreetbets,A Value Perspective Of GME... It ain't much but its honest work,"So I made a bet with u/egregious_trader that I would create an honest valuation DD on GameStop and if it truly was undervalued by any rational standard I would join the cause and purchase 5k worth of stock. After wasting three hours of my life I have come to the conclusion that GameStop is retardedly overvalued. Game stop has has a continuous decline in revenue over the past years. Game Stop has an annual Price to Earning ratio of -$103 and an EV/EBITDA ratio of -68.75x -at the current share price investing at this point you would literally be throwing money away. The only times investors invest in companies that are currently unprofitable is because they expect they will be profitable enough in the future to cover their current downside and looking at GameStop's history even Hellen Keller could tell you it's been on a steady decline. It's also worth mentioning that the TTM financials are inflated due to the first quarter where the skyrocket happened so the numbers would've still been on a decline.  Even if this company was profitable there is still no chance I personally would invest because their business model is fundamentally flawed with an egregious gross profit margin of 24% and a negative net income across the board. Now that we got the valuation out of the way let's talk about every Ape's wet dream ""MOASS"". In the year 2021 when the start first started to skyrocket our Swedish daddy and fabled HOOD CEO took away our buy button to prevent the absolute implosion of a certain hedge fund. Ever since then you've seen a pattern. This pattern is due to the fact that once the price drops far enough hedge funds decide to close out some of their short position causing the stock to the moon for a short period before everyone sells. With the current short interest of 13.42%, I'm sorry to tell you apes that there is 0% for moass to happen with the current sell volume. I created this DD to prove u/egregious wrong and in hopes that this clears up the fog for anyone that was confused about GME and maybe change some ape minds, I doubt it though.",1641974692
2066,wallstreetbets,Just Eat takeaway says Q4 orders are up 14%,"AMSTERDAM, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Just Eat Takeaway.com NV , Europe's largest meals delivery company, on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter order growth of 14% and maintained its financial forecasts for 2022.

In a trading update, the company said it delivered 273.7 million orders in the fourth quarter of 2021, up from 240.4 million in the same period a year earlier.

Takeaway has come under pressure from investors to sell operations including U.S. subsidiary Grubhub as the group is making losses, and the boost that meal delivery companies received from increased orders during the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to fade.

Takeaway did not release its profit and loss figures on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Jitse Groen confirmed that the company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) had improved to a smaller loss than in the first half of 2021.

""We have markedly improved our adjusted EBITDA throughout the second half of 2021, and we will make further improvements this year,"" he said in a statement.

Takeaway is due to report its full earnings on March 2.

In the first half of 2021, the company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of 190 million euros on revenue of 2.6 billion euros.

Takeaway's shares have fallen 11% so far in 2022, closing at 43.27 euros on Tuesday -- far below their all-time high above 109 euros in October 2020.

The company said it had 28.2 billion euros in gross transaction value (GTV), a common industry metric, at the low end of a 28-30 billion euro range. And it confirmed a target of GTV growth in the mid-teens for 2022, with EBITDA margin improving to a negative 0.6%-0.8%, from a negative 1.3% in 2021.

2080,wallstreetbets,U.S. stocks soar across the board! What did Powell say? Will U.S. stocks continue yesterday's rally today?,"U.S. stocks rose again on Tuesday, as Wall Street stocks appeared to stabilize for the time being after a volatile New Year.

The technology-based Nasdaq Composite Index (Nasdaq Composite) rose 1.41 percent to 15,153.45 points, ending a four-day losing streak in the last session. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index rose 0.92 percent to 4,713.07 points; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 183.15 points, or 0.51 percent, to 3,252.02 points.

The stock market has been unstable at the beginning of the year as rising interest rates have put pressure on the stock market. However, rates cooled on Tuesday, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling below 1.75 percent. Jeff Mills, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Wealth Management, said, ""This is just a temporary relief from some pretty extreme selling that has occurred over the last few weeks.""

""I think it may be too early to call a bottom in technology stocks. Given the trend in interest rates, I think there will be at least a day of respite,"" Mills added.

Large technology stocks helped support the broader market, with Amazon (Amazon) up 2.4 percent and Apple (Apple) and Nvidia (Nvidia) up about 1.7 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Elsewhere, with U.S. oil prices breaking through $80 a barrel, Exxon Mobil shares rose more than 4%. Peloton, a home fitness stock, rose 6.4%.

On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before a Senate committee as part of his re-election confirmation process. Powell said he expects supply chain normalization to help ease inflationary pressures in 2022, but said the Fed would not worry about raising rates more than expected if inflation remains high.

""If we have to raise rates further, we will use our tools to ease inflation,"" Powell said. But stocks and bond markets were higher during Powell's testimony, as he did not announce that the Fed would accelerate the pace of policy adjustments. Powell noted that the balance sheet vote will be held later in 2022.

""In a report to clients, BMO's Ian Lyngen said, ""Overall, Powell's comments were consistent with market expectations.

Over the past year, Powell has been trying to balance two risks: first, raising interest rates too soon, which could lead to a prolonged period of high unemployment; and second, providing too much stimulus, leading to entrenched hyperinflation and forcing the U.S. to adjust more quickly afterward.

Fed officials were concerned last year that inflation would cool if supply chain bottlenecks were a major driver of inflation and were expected to reverse over time. But Powell announced the policy shift in late November, when there were signs that the labor market was tightening. He began to express greater concern that stronger-than-expected demand could trigger broader and sustained price pressures, even if the unconventional rise due to supply problems later reversed.

Powell explained at a news conference last month: ""I think there's a real risk now that inflation could become more persistent, that the risk of rising inflation has become more entrenched.""

At Tuesday's hearing Powell said the Fed would use its tools ""to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.

Powell had said that using pre-epidemic labor market benchmarks to guide officials' policy decisions may no longer be appropriate, another sign that rate hikes could begin in March.

""We can begin to see that the post-epidemic economy may be different in some respects. These differences need to be taken into account in the pursuit of our objectives."" Monetary policy needs to ""take a broad and forward-looking view that keeps pace with the changing economy.""

Looking ahead, investors will get an update on the state of the economy later this week, with inflation data due out on Wednesday and major bank earnings reports on Friday.",1641972187

Regardless of this being utterly stupid, it's the most inefficient way of receiving credit in order.

So I marked this post as 'News' cause it's probably news for many of yall.

Here is how you should do it *right*, well at this point you are obliged to since you already committed to leveraging your position, which is something very dangerous and many times stupid to do (wanna learn why? explanation in the comments).


So the thing is that the stock exchange ""knows"" how to give you cheap credit. 
Let's say you have 100,000k in cash (or enough marging for this matter). So what you wanna do is go ahead and sell a deep ITM call for the SPX, for example a 200$ call. In today's values, you will collect a premium of 450,000$. 

Bam done, congrats you've just took a loan of a freaking half a million dollars. Your required collateral is maybe around 50,000$ or even less. And the interest you are paying for it is somewhere around 0.5%-1%. That's because the brokerage house is getting an overnight financing rate which is much lower than what you will receive in a bank. It floats about 50bps or so high than the federal reserve overnight interest rate which currently stands at 0.25%. 

But then you're gonna tell me ""Are you a focking ape man? you are leaving me exposed to the S&amp;P movement, that's not a loan, that's a liability!""
Well hold it right there champ, I've got another gift box 🎁  for you. See what I did there? yeah, what's in gonna teach you now is what is a box. A box is when you completely hedge your position to get 0 effect on your delta, gamma, theta, Vega, which means you are not actually exposed to the market. How do you do that?

You need to go ahead and buy a synthetic contact on the same S&amp;P index. You buy a call and sell a put with the same strike, for example buy a 4700$ call and sell a 4700$ put. This should cost you practically zero or almost zero. By now you have offseted the short position you entered into in order to get the loan, with an identical long position which cost you 0. A fuckin magical box. 

So now you have 450k sitting in your brokerage account, and all you need to decide is what's the fastest way to loose'em. Can't help you here.

2166,wallstreetbets,VALE - Quick Due Diligence: Can this undervalued mining stock moon?,"Vale is one of the largest metals mining companies in the world based in Brazil. 

Current stock price is 15.24 at close on January 11th 2022. 
Th e stock is up 11.5% in the past 5 trading days.
Up 20% for the year so far. 
and up 37% from the bottom in November.

It has broken through a few key resistance levels on the daily chart and I think there is still tremendous upside in the weeks and months ahead. 

Hot sector play: With rapidly rising inflation and the threat of fed tightening causing increased volatility in the markets, institutional investors are rapidly shifting money to cyclicals, industrials, materials and undervalued value stocks with high free cash flow that pay attractive dividends. 

Company: About 60% of Vales revenue comes from its iron ore business with sales going mostly to China but many other countries as well. 17% of revenues come from Nickel and Copper sales. Obviously iron is used for making steel, copper used in electronics and nickel in batteries all key materials that are in high demand by the electronic vehicle industry which is a hot sector right now. 

The P/E ratio (TTM) is around 4x which is extremely low relative to the average 15 P/E in the materials sector. Much lower than peers RIO and BHP. eps (TTM) is around $3.5

Last year the company returned a whopping 20% dividend yield ($2.7 per share) over three instalments, March, June and September. In prior years they always paid out an irregular dividend but in 2020 they normalized their payouts to at least two per year in March and September with possibly more. Vale has tremendous free cash flow and will likely continue to payout substantial dividends, the first dividend will be announced late February around Q4 earnings. 

The stock is very reasonably priced and very buyable by your average robinhood/webull/wealthsimple retail trader which makes it appealing as a meme or hype stock. Because of the low SP the percentage gains are much larger. Institutional investors are already buying the stock quickly, in combination with retail the stock has the potential to moon. 

If you want the capital gains and outsized dividends buy the stock, if you want to time the rally and take greater risk (with higher potential gains) buy the calls.",1641959534

2204,wallstreetbets,"If you think we're in a bubble, you should short SPYG and NOT SPY.","Leaving the argument if we're in a bubble for another time, I can say most people go about it in all the wrong ways. Buying puts on a broad market ETF is inefficient since you're shorting both the bad and the good.

Bubbles form around mass speculation and pumping of assets, so any and all stocks artificially boosted by a bubble will be classed as ""growth"" stocks. Especially growth stocks perceived as recession-proof and/or ""the future"" of this or that. So if there is a bubble right now, it involves at least one of the following:

1. Meme stocks.

2. Green energy.

3. Currency mines auto-censored on this sub.

4. Innovative startups.

5. Select software developers.

6. 3d printing.

7. Space launch startups.

8. Tech stocks.

9. Chinese stocks.

10. Cloud services/ecommerce.

Particularly you're looking for high volatility, whether going up, down, or sideways. You are also looking for something with a lack of bearish sentiment, and/or the bears get ridiculed for even bring it up. I.E. If there's a sub that will ban you for posting a bear case, it might be a bubble. You will see this point proven below in the comments with people getting angry their favorite stock was included. Don't worry, I included some of my favorite stocks too.

I mention SPYG because it's a market cap weighted fund tracking the S&amp;P 500 perceived as growth stocks. I do not need to tell you what the top 10 holding are and that those holdings are over half the fund.

Another candidate for your puts is any ARK fund as almost everything they got is on the above list Disclosure: I own SARK, the Short ARK fund.

There's also the Future Fund (FFND), a wannabe ARK fund. This one doesn't have options available and I can't recommend short selling such a volatile asset.

The other way people go about predicting a bubble is imposing brutal deadlines on themselves. Sure, those weeklies offer The Big Short type leverage but the odds that you are not only right but right within the anticipated time frame are astronomical. You should be able to hold you position indefinitely until you get the ""I told you so"" moment.",1641953655

2208,wallstreetbets,"The Fed is trapped, they have to hike rates, but they wont make it very far before breaking the markets this time. I predict only 5 rate hikes this cycle, details below","The fed has fucked up.  Inflation wasn't transitory and their favorite measure, core PCE, is the highest it's been in 4 decades.  


Now they have to look like they are fighting inflation by raising rates and tapering asset purchases.  They are talking quite a big game right now.  Many fed officials are talking about a fed funds rate at 3-4% and several are even mentioning balance sheet runoff.  


I'm here to tell you they are completely full of shit.  We won't even get close to 4% fed funds rate this cycle.  And that's because as a nation we are increasingly dependent on low interest rates to finance the national debt (as well as private debt).    


That's because the national debt has absolutely exploded over time.  Debt to GDP has increased from 30% in the 70s to 125% now.

https://preview.redd.it/767ffk2tx5b81.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b3beaabaa8f5ffdb07d31b660c0341055d61945

&amp;#x200B;

This massive increase in the debt means that interest payments on that debt increase as the fed raises interest rates.  Thus every hiking cycle for the past 40 years has resulted in a lower and lower peak fed funds rate before the market brakes and the fed capitulates and begins easing again.  The last peak in 2018 was a fed funds rate of 2.25-2.50% before markets plunged 25% in the 4th quarter.

But the debt is even higher now than it was in 2018, so we know the next ceiling will have to be lower as well.  I've analyzed this by looking at the average of the fed funds rate and the 5-year treasury yield and multiplying that combined rate by the national debt.    


If we assume both rates increase in tandem by 25 basis points per quarter, and the national debt goes up a paltry $300 billion quarterly then we will cap out at 1.5% this cycle.  Likely in the 2nd quarter of 2023. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So when markets are crashing after only the 5th rate hike, and inflation is still running at over 5% annually, just know that the fed is going to capitulate and save the markets by easing again.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a big problem, because you need treasury yields to get above inflation expectations in order to encourage savings instead of spending to stop inflation.  In the 70s, with debt to GDP at only 30%, we were able to do just that.  It wasn't painless (look at the recession of the early 80s), but we did it.  With inflation at 5-10%, we can't even get close to stopping it without absolutely decimating the stock market and the economy.   


The fed is trapped.  They are going to have to choose between switching to easing and saving the economy and stock market, or continuing to hike to kill inflation, but also possibly causing the great depression 2.0.  I'm confident they will choose to save markets and stop fighting inflation as the tradeoff, which means that inflation trades at that point will be going absolutely bananas.    


And that's because the US will be embarking on monetary policy akin to a banana republic by lowering rates while experiencing high inflation.   


Make sure you get your bananas over the next year or so to prepare for this utter bullshit of a ride that the fed is about to take us on.  For me that means precious metals (specifically silver via PSLV and physical, not SLV which is a bullshit ETF).  For others it could mean commodities or real estate or just buying a whole bunch of shit before it goes up in price.

2318,wallstreetbets,Intel and the New Cold War,"Intel has become ""too important to fail"" in our new Cold War with China. As we saw with US Intelligence threatening to withhold information from allies using Huawei network equipment, Intel market-share will be protected by Western governments. Intel's new God-CEO Pat Gelsinger separately met with Presidents Macron and Biden, in private. Intel has and will continue to receive billions per year in government subsidies and contracts, in the interest of national security.

China has recently been Intel's largest market by revenue, and when China builds its own processors (matter of time), Intel will still maintain a signification portion of the high-performance Chinese market (think Apple), and unless China decides to ban Intel, no Chinese company will make major inroads into Western Markets due to security/intelligence concerns (think Huawei). So Intel will be in the position of Apple with access to Chinese markets without much global competition from Chinese manufacturers. You will see Intel cater to the CCP, and that is fine, but Intel will never be beholden to the CCP and thus can remain in the good graces of Western Governments.

New CEO Pat Gelsinger is a former Intel superstar engineer, his tenure marked the end of Intel's marketing-style of business, and no longer just rebrands existing technology for more money. Intel's offerings have already caught up with AMD in the desktop segment and will catch up in the server market segment sometime in 2023-2024, by 2024/2025, Intel will have become the uncontested king of desktop/server by 2025 with the unique position of having its own fabs.

TSMC is a wonderful company that has not failed AMD so far but vertical integration beats partnerships nearly every time. Intel will have its own fab business, not only benefitting from vertical integration but also having extra revenue/margins from its fab business, selling to the competitors like Apple or Google.

&amp;#x200B;

Intel revenue = **$19 bln**, AMD revenue = **$4.3 bln**

Intel P/E ratio = **11**, AMD's ratio = **43**

Intel Margins **= 36%,** AMD Margins **= 21%**

Intel market cap = **$227 bln**, AMD market cap = **$166 bln**

2336,wallstreetbets,Carvana seems to be the newest most puttable stock,"With the news today from GM about their new CarBravo service, essentially a direct competitor to Carvana that helps dealers put used car lots online, I can't help but think this is the final nail in the coffin that sentences Carvana to death. In addition to the competition, Carvana has never made cash from their operations, and their current long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 2.20 is considerably risky, especially given the anticipated future rate increases. In addition to the addition, if Carvana can't make money in the red-hot used car market we've had over the past year, I don't see how there's any way they could make money in any market.

The stock has already fallen 51% this year, but I can't imagine this company surviving the next 10 years, and I believe it's now the most puttable stock. Thoughts?",1641938045

For example,  to a person who only buys stock based on stock price, AT&amp;T looks horrible. Its now at a 5 year low, but at $24 stock price and $2 dividend, thats an 8 % annual return. thats right, 100k invested will pay you 8k every year. Reinvest those returns and you have a compound effect. 

IF the price goes up or down, those returns aren’t affect.

To me there is only one possible solution. 

Roblox is the key to the future. Ive seen that site grow from nothing and now everybody’s playing it. It is also a meta play which everybody knows will be a grand slam hit. Other things going for roblox has great earnings capabilities, they have extremely low costs, and they are even thinking of starting other ventures that should make them exponentially more valuable.

I have sold every asset that i own and ive parked most into RBLX stock and LEAPs. Im currently down about 30% but that is simply due to hedge fund short pressure that should reside in the next few weeks. trust me ive done my research on it. 

Ive also allocated 25% to sit in robux because it theoretically cant have inflation problems. Roblox cant print robux at near the rate we print USD. And i can also use it to value invest in rare roblox items that should triple in value as the site grows. 

I plan to post the results when i hit 1B which should be about 4 years according to my calculations.

There are no other fees AFAIK.

Then I realize ZIM yields 18%, and I can actually profit from this, so I made a spreadsheet. 

Assume +-2% fluctuation in price, and before every payment is due, I sell just enough share to pay for it. With dividend reinvested, or with premium from CCs reinvested/used to pay the loan. I can actually come out on top. Even if the share price actually tanked -40% in 3 years, I can still make a profit, and that's not even considering premiums and inflation.

It's not retarded as is to take out loans to YOLO on FDs, but it still seems stupid asf. 

Someone talk me out of this, please.

2496,wallstreetbets,"Revolutionizing the music industry, NFT's are challenging streaming services.","According to a recent Rolling Stones article, A typical Spotify artist earned just over **$12 per month.** Well that 12$ will go far in a cafe for a day, but making a living off of streaming… well not unless you're a top tier musician and that’s about just 1% of artists on the various streaming services. If you're the rest of the 9.9 million artists on Spotify you are struggling to gain listers to justify your effort.

* Spotify paid the artists **$0.0032** per stream
* Apple Music got the average rate of **$0.0056**
* Google Play Music landed a **$0.0055** payout rate
* Deezer fell slightly lower at **$0.00436**  


And on the higher end, 13,000 musicians catalogs earned a respectable $50,000 per year out of the 10 Million artists trying to earn from this revenue stream. Needless to say, artists are looking for additional revenue streams or a totally different concept to keep their lights on.

One company looking to disrupt this space is a blockchain startup [NFTtone](https://www.nfttone.io/) . By allowing artists to upload special releases of their music, samples, or any audio stream and publishing it on their Music NFT marketplace. Fans and the community of the artist can purchase this limited asset using TONE’s  currency, hold it, resell it or otherwise treat the limited or a one of a kind asset as an investment.

Imagine being the exclusive owner of the first 10 seconds to a David Guetta song, or the rift to your favorite artist… bragging rights here are far beyond that of a traditional punk NFT. Getting the idea?.

The artist on the other hand can earn in one day what would take them months to acquire the listenership on any streaming network to earn the equivalent, and this was the [NFTtone](https://www.nfttone.io/) purpose.

# “I know there are a lot of people who create great music that never gets heard, art that can provide us with great experiences and trigger intense emotions. I intend to change this.” NFTtone CEO, John Modahl.

**Live concerts**

Remember that last concert you went to and bought the band's swag t-shirt for 50$ , how proud did you feel walking around with it, and how happy was the band that it was selling merch.

Take this same concept and roll it into an NFT.. Love the song you just heard the band play, instead of buying a hat that will end up being buried with the other tshirts, eventually making its way out for the occasional Netflix and chill.

Fans will scan the Qr Code of the songs or rifts being offered from the concert, and purchase the limited series of that song. Once sold out, other fans will have to then offer the current owners a price they are willing to part with it for..

So that hat… right.. Cool.. but .. not as cool as a collection of limited series NFT’s from live concerts.

Still questioning the value of the music NFT? People are still buying ticket stubs, you can still buy

1985 Live Aid Concert ticket, featuring QUEEN U2, Sting-Elton John for nearly **$2000!**

Yes, like NFT’s, old ticket stubs are limited in number, but unlike NFT’s you can't do much with them other than frame it.

An NFT of that concert would be a track, an intro, a moment of time captured on the smartchain, that you own, hold or trade and play. Getting the picture now?

[NFTtone](https://www.nfttone.io/) is in the process of signing multiple deals with well known artists, while at the same time, updating and releasing their new marketplace.

One thing is for certain, NFT’s was a 7 billion dollar market last year on just images, music NFT’s should catapult this number to record numbers and be a real use case while creating equity within the music marketplace.

We are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion.

GME, AMC, &amp; CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude.

**GME** \- Was being shorted pre-2020 because as per ""technical"" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model (aka E-Commerce) and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc.

**AMC** \- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors ""Picking"" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play.

**CLOV** \- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds.

Yes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that.

All 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other.

WSB is a VERY LARGE CASINO, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion.

If you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a CASINO and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker that's not GME or AMC).

Now with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3.

Don't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved.

Everyone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all.

People just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous.

Also, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to continue to wait until inflation hits the top and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto their positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion).

Some plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on.

WSB is a damn CASINO, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idgaf.",1641919889

2582,wallstreetbets,DD Shopify $SHOP: the biggest NYSE traded Ponzi,"Good day to you all and me. I have received a few messages asking me how I connect my statement that Shopify is a Ponzi to disappearance, probably, murder of the head of Shopify treasury, Brett O’Grady. Here I decided to connect all information that I base my statement on.

To not ruin the presentation I say my positions in advance:

A lot of puts 150-200 strike range Jan22 and some 160-300 range for Jun22 and Sep22. This company will go to 0. I am poor so my positions do not qualify for YOLO post.
 
Let’s begin:

Shopify “has” substantial growth of book revenue for the last 2 years.
Shopify claims that they have generated 1.12 bln. Revenue in 3Q 2021. They claim that this much revenue was generated by 42 bln. of Gross Merchandise Volume (hereafter - GMV) of all Shopify stores.

*Exhibit from latest 10Q:

“Key performance indicators, which we do not consider to be non-GAAP measures, that we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions include Monthly Recurring Revenue (""MRR"") and Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV""). Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies. The following table shows MRR and GMV for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020...
...Three months ended September 30, Gross Merchandise Volume $ 41,764,997”

There are some companies for comparison 3Q 2021: Coca-Cola with all subsidiaries - 10.4 bln. revenue, Phizer - 24 bln. revenue. Yes, Shopify says that Shopify stores selling yoga equipment or metal straws sold more than two companies from S&amp;P 500 combined.

This can be true: Shopify powers stores of Pepsi Co., Staples, Fenty Beauty, right?

Wrong!
Pepsi does not sell from its website, B2B only, Staples and Fenty Beauty do not have SHOPIFY PAYMENTS checkout meaning they are not part of revenue sharing plan, you can check it yourself.

Why Shopify payments is important? Because it composes 50% of all Shopify revenue or 75% of merchant solutions revenue.

*Exhibit from latest 40F

“Merchant solutions revenues increased $1,084.8 million, or 115.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in merchant solutions revenues was primarily a result of Shopify Payments revenue growing by $835.2 million, or 121.2%, in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.”

Formula: $835.2 /121.2% + $835.2  = 1,524 mln. Payments revenue of 2,021 mln. Merchant solutions revenue in 2020.

So Shopify is now a fintech company? If it is, it has the best equipment in the world that can generate &gt;300x yearly revenue of its book value:

*Exhibit from the latest 40-F

“10. Property and Equipment, December 31, 2020
Computer equipment Net book value $ 9,331”

Or rents the best equipment in the world:

*Exhibit from the latest 10-q

“The components of lease expense were as follows:
Nine months ended September 30, 2021
Operating lease expense 16,041
Variable lease expense, including non-lease components 9,210
Total lease expense 25,251”
 
Really, it doesn’t. There are 10 000 employees at the moment. It means that IT company has 980 USD of computer equipment per employee. That means that this company only has PC for each employee and probably a couple of old servers for accounting department. That’s it!

The reality is that Shopify payments is a Stripe with Shopify logo on it:

*Exhibit from latest 40F

“We currently rely on a single supplier to provide the technology we offer through Shopify Payments.

At present, we have payment service provider agreements with Stripe, Inc. (""Stripe""), which automatically renew every 12 months, unless either party terminates the agreement earlier upon 180 days' notice. These agreements are integral to Shopify Payments and, at this time, any disruption or problems with Stripe or its services could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial results. We have the ability, under our current agreements, to integrate alternative payment service providers for Shopify Payments. However, if Stripe were to terminate its relationship with us before an alternative payment service provider was fully integrated we could incur substantial delays and expense, and the quality and reliability of such alternative payment service provider may not be comparable.”

The whole responsibility for Shopify payments is on Stripe according to the contact (section 5, it is a bit long, didn’t quote):

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000119312515129273/d863202dex1011.htm

 
Despite that Shopify has no responsibility over payments and has no infrastructure it still recognizes revenue as a principal despite that in reality it is acting as an agent:

*Exhibit from latest 40F:

“The Company follows the guidance provided in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent in arrangements with customers that involve another party that contributes to providing a specified service to a customer. In these instances, the Company determines whether it has promised to provide the specified service itself (as principal) or to arrange for the specified service to be provided by another party (as an agent). This determination depends on the facts and circumstances of each arrangement and, in some instances, involves significant judgment. The Company recognizes revenue from Shopify Shipping, the sales of apps and Shop Pay Installments on a net basis as the Company is not primarily responsible for the fulfillment, does not have control of the promised service, and does not have full discretion in establishing prices and therefore is the agent in the arrangement with merchants. All other revenue is reported on a gross basis, as the Company has determined it is the principal in the arrangement.”

Note that Shop Pay instalments are not Shopify Payments. These are two different products.

Why it is important? (writing like Motley fool, lol, it is because they are publishing bullish article about Shopify every day and I read them).

It is important because even with abuse of Point-of-sale revenue recognition method for Shopify payments Company is still overvalued by PE metric.
And there are two ways to increase profit:   
1. To cut costs – impossible, because all costs are commission of Stripe   
2. To increase revenue – possible.   

This brings us to the thesis why Shopify is Ponzi.
In order to show higher profit Shopify Inc. creates fake stores and makes fake sales from them.
There is a study published in Forbes supporting this statement:  
https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/01/18/analysis-of-124044-shopify-stores-says-25788-are-fraudulent-or-dangerous/?sh=630d5ce73cd5

Revenue from these fake stores is not real but cost of sales (fee of Stripe) is real and Shopify has constant cash outflows from its operations.
It is surviving only by friquent SPOs: Feb 2018, Dec 2018, Sep 2019, May 2020, Sep 2020, Feb 2021 (see 10Q and 40F).

This brings us to the darkest part of fraud.
Shopify gets clear audit opinion. Cash balance is confirmed. Does it mean that if cash flow statement is correct and balance is correct then P&amp;L is correct?
Not neceserally. What is in the cash balance? 71% of cash is marketable securities:

*Exhibit from latest 40-F

“As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $2,703,597 and $649,916, respectively. These balances included $1,927,013 and $423,443, respectively, of money market funds, repurchase agreements, U.S. federal bonds and corporate bonds and commercial paper.”

And there are 2 ways how to get marketable securities: 
1 – Buy them with cash 
2 – Buy them on margin
Shopify got these marketable securities on margin because they don’t have that much cash. Auditors send confirmation request to broker of Shopify and receive an answer with open positions but without margin. Clear audit opinion is in the pocket. In quarterly statements no need for such manipulation because there is no audit. Cash balance can also be used as collateral or Shopify could provide a bank guarantee. There are many ways to get a margin.

One day head of Shopify treasury, Brett O’Grady, sees financial statements and asks the top management why margin is not presented in them (in liabilities section of balance sheet). (This is fine. I am responsible for preparing financial statement at my current work place and the head of treasury is my closest friend. He has never seen FS of our company despite that I send them to all employees of finance department. He doesn’t care because it is not his responsibility). After getting no real answer or answer that Shopify is committing a fraud.  And seeing that it is the reason why 20 executives left the company in the past 2 years:

https://timesnewsexpress.com/editorials/at-least-20-executives-have-left-shopify-in-the-last-year-of-enormous-growth-for-the-e-commerce-platform-heres-a-running-list-of-the-departures-and-what-theyre-up-to-next/

He calculates 2 + 2 and says something wrong.
Then Shopify executives make him disappear from this world. Leaving wife and his child:  
https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/search-continues-for-shopify-exec-reported-missing-in-ottawa-1.5626544

There is no sign of violence. Bike is in perfect condition. He just disappeared. His father says that it is not in his character. Because there is no body homicide case can’t be open. To clear possible trace and avoid suspicion Shopify hires private investigation firm:

https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/shopify-engages-private-firm-to-support-search-for-executive-reported-missing-in-ottawa-1.5633495

TLDR: Shopify operates under the following scheme:
Create fake stores -&gt; make fictional sales through them -&gt; report revenue growth -&gt; do SPO when Stripe eats all your money -&gt; repeat -&gt; at the end of the year for auditors buy marketable securities on margin and remaining cash to get clean opinion. 

Support it by paying Motley fool to publish a bullish thesis on you every day and spending 500 mln. in a year sales and marketing. 

If there is a risk of Stripe going public and your fraud to be exposed purchase &lt;1% of Stripe for the amount of your yearly R&amp;D budget (400 mln.) It will satisfy Stripe for some time.

Why I performed such investigation on Shopify, what made me target this company? It is pure coincidence driven by my low IQ and dirty pumping. As a true retard I started my play with stocks in 2021. I read Motley fool and bought SHOP myself, it was my first stock. Only after it I read 40F myself and sold it in panic.",1641919043

2613,wallstreetbets,$GME's business model change will be far more bullish than you realize,"RC &amp; Co are a smart group, and I believe this NFT push is going to be far more transformative than what most people believe.

**Current theory:** 
The prevailing theory I see about this NFT business model shift is that GME will simply create a marketplace, where gamers can buy and sell “second-hand” digital game copies and in-game items. While this is most likely true, I believe it is only one feature of GME’s new business model, which will transform the entire gaming industry for the better. I think everyone is currently thinking too small.

The fatal flaw with this theory lies in the economics. Currently, developers gets a juicy 75%+ cut of digital game sales. When it’s decided that the full-price paying gamer cohort has been tapped out, the price will be reduced - this rejuvenates volume growth at a lower price point, but the devs still get their 75%+ cut. Rinse and repeat until they hit some price at which they determine price elasticity evaporates. In other words, the devs have it pretty good right now, and there will need to be something very compelling offered to allow a third party like GME to get in on the action.

**Why it’s wrong:** If a digital game copy is allowed to be re-sold to someone else, there's a strong possibility it's cannibalizing what would have been a direct sale withthat 75%+ take rate for the developer. While it’s tempting to say that the availability of cheaper second-hand digital copies would drive more overall revenue for devs, keep in mind that this price-sensitive cohort will eventually be mostly captured as the game price is lowered over time. It is very unlikely that GME would be able to work out the economics with devs such that (1) the developer is agnostic as to whether the game is bought direct from the online store or bought from another gamer (i.e. they break even on that 75% new sale take rate), (2) GME can turn a profit, and (3) there's enough money left over for the game seller to even bother to sell the game in the first place.

**What I believe the new business will actually be:** I believe GME's plan is to buy up rights to be the exclusive online distributor for specific titles, essentially purchasing all virtual ""copies"" of the game from the dev. This would provide the devs with a much-desired certainty of game ""success"" for new/riskier games; essentially pushing the risk of game success or failure from the dev onto GME. GME would then turn around and distribute the virtual copies to gamers, likely for a minimal profit - but they'd make the real money over time by taking a healthy chunk of the digital game re-sales/trade-ins (similar to how they took a chunk out of your trade-in values when you were a kid) and taking a cut of peer-to-peer in-game item sales/swaps. This will add risk to GME's business model, but imagine the upside on having monetization rights forever for a new, not-yet-released video game that becomes a multigenerational legend like Goldeneye on N64... That could easily pay for 100 failures on its own.

**Benefits of this business model:**

* This solves a structural problem in the gaming industry whereby each developer carries concentrated title risk in its own portfolio of games. If this risk can be mitigated by selling exclusive rights to GME, then GME will have enough titles in aggregate to largely offset the risk to its overall portfolio of acquired titles. In other words, each individual developer on its own carries a lot of risk (one project blowup can seriously damage a dev's investor enthusiasm) – but if the title risk of many developers is pooled together, the aggregate risk declines. Similar to how owning 50 stocks is a lot less risky than owning 5 (I know this sentence will fall on deaf ears).

* The fact that this business model would be predicated on the recurring cash flow from future peer to peer transactions means that GME is less reliant on a large commission on the up-front digital purchases. This means that GME would be able to signicantly undercut the Steam/Xbox/Playstations of the world on pricing, offering either a more attractive price for devs (higher cut), a cheaper price for players, or both. This would allow them to take share from incumbents and secure attractive titles for their platform.

* This would also drive more interest from gamers in buying new, unproven titles - if they don't like it, they can at least re-sell or trade-in and recoup some of their money. Perhaps GME could even offer a short free trial of its games.

**Bigger picture vision:** If successful, this could transform the video game industry by solving many of the industry's major issues today. Most of the issues we see with big devs today stem from the fact that they're public companies under investor pressure to generate attractive returns on their development spend. As a result, they have become too reluctant to pioneer new concepts, instead leaning on new iterations of old successful concepts. Additionally, the financial pressure to release games on time (even if they're not finished yet) is clearly winning out, to the detriment of game quality.

* Devs being able to offload the downside risk (and the upside potential) of new title success onto GME would completely transform the attractiveness of risky brand new titles for devs, potentially ushering in a whole new era of completely unique games (rather than the 57th iteration of Halo). This risk offload option would turn new titles from a too-risky-to-invest project into a predictable ROI cash cow.

* This could also reduce the issue of buggy/unfinished releases. If GME is going to agree to buy the exclusive rights to a game and assume the risk of failure, they're going to be doing some serious due diligence - I'm imagining an in-house game testing team (sign me up) who QC's games before agreeing to buy the rights. In fact, they would probably be extensively testing each game before buying to determine whether they think it has a chance of being a hit. GME's financial incentives are aligned with the desires of gamers, driving trust that they would only offer high-quality games. This goes a long way towards user adoption.

**This would cause wall street to take interest:** Apes got this company back on the map, but in order for this stock to really moon (MOASS aside), institutional interest will need to be piqued. If GME does pursue the business model I've outlined here, it would be a compelling business model shift which will inevitably drive a pivot in institutional investors' perception (currently institutional investors erroneously view GME as an uninvestable joke stock).

* Wall Street would consider this a win-win for both the devs and GME, as GME gets a nice compounding recurring revenue stream (makes wall street drool), and devs get to convert what was previously a risky undertaking (new titles) into a low-risk cash cow, which also makes wall street drool.

* To top off the reasons for the forthcoming wall street GME circle jerk, this business model would create what's known in finance buzzword-ville as a ""flywheel"": GME makes a large up-front investment to obtain exclusive rights to a sizeable library of games -&gt; users join the platform, enticed by new exclusive titles + peer to peer marketplace -&gt; growing userbase prompts devs to sell an increasing # of their more popular titles exclusively to GME -&gt; more users join -&gt; more titles sold to GME -&gt; entire gaming industry transformed due to low-risk pioneering for devs -&gt; more people start playing video games due to a wider variety of interesting content without bugs -&gt; more users join the platform -&gt; more titles sold exclusively to GME -&gt; more users.... it goes on forever.

Eventually, I envision GME as capturing the majority of game distribution market share.

*Primary risk: I think the primary risk to this business model is that Microsoft and Sony try to work together to eliminate this threat or attempt to copy GME. However, I doubt they would have enough bargaining power to do so; the devs call the shots in this industry, and if GME is offering a better take rate, they will win their exclusive title rights. As for the ability for someone to copy this business model, I believe this business model offers a huge first mover advantage with strong network effects. In essence, this means that having a large user base means more items available in the second-hand marketplace, making it more and more attractive as that userbase grows. The incumbent players in this space have their entire business and cost structure designed around the old way of doing things, while GME has likely been working on this since RC joined the company. By the time those incumbents get around to copycatting GME, it will be too late, as the user base size will make it too attractive to replicate. Compare it to Google trying to launch its answer to Facebook - Google Plus. Once Facebook's user base reached a critical mass, attempting to compete with them in that space was a total miss.

Side note, I'm just going to get ahead of this - if you look at my post history, I responded to a few comments today talking about why I do not believe a short squeeze is coming. My rationale is outlined in those posts if you would like to peruse, although I would prefer to keep the short squeeze talk out of this post since I believe in significant upside regardless of that issue.",1641915758

The latest inflation report from the U.S. Department of Labor on Wednesday will provide the answer, and the much-anticipated report will bring a final conclusion to a year of high inflation driven by supply chain gridlock, labor shortages and strong spending!

**According to a media survey of economists, the U.S. CPI is expected to rise 0.4% in December from a year earlier and 7% year over year, which would be the largest year-over-year increase since February 1982. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the U.S. core CPI is also expected to rise 0.5% in December from a year earlier and 5.4% from a year earlier.**

https://preview.redd.it/aqqhd94kt2b81.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=768a0fc5e1792ff1c7188ff056faf4a055d3e87b

The continued acceleration in U.S. price inflation through much of 2021 has prompted Fed officials to consider earlier and faster rate hikes and even tapering. Minutes from the Fed's most recent monetary policy meeting noted that supply chain disruptions and labor shortages may last longer than officials initially anticipated, further suggesting that high consumer prices could persist even if inflation cools in 2022.

**What kind of year-end report card will U.S. inflation data deliver?**

**As of last November, U.S. CPI data has been at or above 5% for seven consecutive months.** Among them, the U.S. CPI rose 6.8% year-over-year in November, the largest increase in nearly 40 years.

https://preview.redd.it/ef9jf6jqt2b81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73ecf942df803005c0fb8b77d4c5d61d637e273e

In the last inflation report, one of the major drivers of CPI growth was the rise in energy prices, with the energy breakdown in the November CPI report rising 33%. **And the latest signs flowing now suggest that the rate of U.S. energy price increases will likely slow in December. However, this does not mean that the overall upward pressure on prices will ease, because the rapid spread of the Omicron virus is expected to continue to put pressure on the already precarious supply chain.**

Investment bank Barclays expects inflationary pressures in the U.S. energy sector to ease slightly in December, but food prices are expected to remain strong. The bank's December U.S. CPI year-over-year rise is expected to be 6.9%, slightly below the median market estimate, and the chain rate of increase is expected to be 0.4%, in line with market forecasts.

Specifically, Barclays expects U.S. energy prices to fall 0.7% in December from a year earlier, which would be the first year-over-year drop in energy prices in six months. However, Barclays believes that as the economy continues to reopen, a pickup in demand for hospitality services could put further upward pressure on service sector prices, and labor shortages under the epidemic will also lead to further price pressures in certain service categories.

In addition, the UBS report expects the U.S. CPI to top 7% in December and likely peak at around 7.3% in January and February before finally falling back at the start of spring.

UBS reported that although the CPI in December food and energy prices will slow down, but core prices are expected to continue to rise in the coming months. Among them, motor vehicle prices are expected to remain strong, and import prices and rentals are also expected to rise steadily. In addition, airline tickets and medical services are also expected to make positive contributions to price increases.

The months of November and December before the end of the year are traditionally the peak season for discount sales in the United States. In recent media reports, it seems that this year's sales season is not a new thing around the United States to see the sale of goods. Especially worth mentioning is that in the United States this year, inflation plays an important role in the rise of used cars, before the end of last year, the price is not the slightest sign of falling back.

The latest Manheim Index, which measures trends in used car prices, shows that U.S. used car prices rose again in December by 1.6 percent from a year earlier to 236.2, a year-on-year increase of 46.6 percent.

**The Thorn in Wall Street Traders' Side: Inflation Report**

By looking at the inflation data released this week, Fed watchers will undoubtedly get a clearer picture of whether the first rate hike could come as soon as March, and when the Fed will begin to reduce its $8.8 trillion balance sheet.

**And given that global bond markets, technology stocks and cryptocurrencies began the New Year with a major sell-off due to Fed tightening expectations, Wednesday's inflation data has undoubtedly become a major ""thorn in the side"" and ""thorn in the flesh"" for Wall Street traders trading at the start of the week!**

Shoichi Arisawa, managing director of investment research at IwaiCosmo Securities, said, ""It's hard to make aggressive bets on Wednesday's U.S. CPI data before it's released.""

Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at Exinity Group, noted, ""Last week, rising bond yields and expectations of an exit from the stimulus program dragged U.S. stocks lower as the S&amp;P 500 had its worst start to the year since 2016. And right now the market is expecting U.S. CPI data to hit a 40-year high when it is released. A further unexpected rise in inflation data could put more pressure on the bond market, which could push yields even higher.""

Nomura Securities cross-asset strategist Charlie McElligott mentioned in his latest report that, given the Fed's commitment to fighting inflation, unless the U.S. CPI data released on Wednesday is extremely weak, there may be nothing to drive the bond market to a significant rally in the near future catalyst.

**In fact, compared to the specific performance of tonight's CPI data, the prevailing expectations of the industry right now that U.S. inflation may remain high is perhaps more worrisome.** The latest monthly survey released by the New York Fed on Monday showed that the median consumer expectation for inflation over the next year remained unchanged at a high 6%, still the highest level since the data was launched in June 2013; the expectation for inflation over the next three years also remained unchanged, still at 4%.

https://preview.redd.it/lqt6y4a1u2b81.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9df4d83abc9ae7162e59453d6fbd65ee3a006f4

Jason Furman, former White House chief economist and Harvard professor, said he expects U.S. inflation to remain high this year, with his average forecast for the core personal consumption expenditures price index at 3.2 percent, which is higher than the median 2.7 percent forecast by Federal Reserve policymakers at their Dec. 14-15 meeting.

""Inflation has taken hold, as price increases in many parts of the world will not be temporary and there are supply chain issues that will persist."" Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said, ""This does mean that central banks will be very keen to go down the path of tightening.""",1641914891

17. What's the Fed's stance on social, racial, climate equality issues?
18. How can the Fed be independent, and not engage in ""controversial"" issues - the Fed's dual mandate is full employment and price stability - not on social issues.

The U.S. Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on the nomination of Jerome Powell for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. In a speech prepared for Tuesday's Senate hearing, Jerome Powell said the Fed will prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched, while warning that the post-pandemic economy may look different from the previous expansion cycle. Powell further explained that the U.S. economy is growing rapidly and the labor market is strong. It is possible to begin to see that the economy may look different in some ways after a new crown epidemic, and pursuing the Fed's objectives will need to take these differences into account. To that end, the Fed's monetary policy must maintain breadth and foresight, keeping pace with the evolving economy.

Fed official: March rate hike may be appropriate, 3 rate hikes expected in 2022

With interest rate hikes inching closer and closer, market forecasts of a rate hike in March this year soaring to nearly 90%, it has almost become a nail in the coffin and Fed officials have come forward to take a stand. On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Bostic said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that interest rate hikes could be initiated as early as March, and that there may be three rate hikes this year, or even four, and that the balance sheet would begin to shrink ""fairly soon"" after the first rate hike to curb soaring inflation.

Bostic does not enjoy voting rights this year. Bostic said the soaring inflation and job market is very strong, and the Fed is expected to act in March. The current economy is still on a positive track, employment and the economy will continue to grow strongly, inflation will continue for some time, and price pressures are expected to moderate.

Shortly before Clarida tendered his resignation, the New York Times and Bloomberg had publicly questioned his stock trading in February 2020. Clarida sold three stock funds on Feb. 24, 2020, and then bought one back three days later when the stock market was in turmoil due to the new crown pneumonia outbreak. clarida filed revised financial statements last month, which the Federal Reserve said were omitted from its initial filing.

Four rate hikes are just the beginning! Traders are already frantically hedging against a more aggressive Fed

The market is betting on a more aggressive Fed, and some traders may be hedging against the risk of five or even six rate hikes. Goldman Sachs recently raised the expected number of Fed rate hikes this year from three to four, and JPMorgan Chase even believes there will be more than four rate hikes this year. Bloomberg said that with market prices predicting an average policy tightening of close to a full 1 percentage point, some traders may be hedging the risk of five or even six rate hikes. In addition to that, options traders believe the Fed will raise rates eight times, 25 basis points each, by early 2024, up from previous expectations of about six times. Consumers have lowered their expectations for price increases in essential goods in the coming year. They now expect gasoline prices to rise 5.7% in the coming year, down from the 9.2% increase expected in November, and food prices to rise 7.8%, down from the 9.2% increase expected in November. Consumers' expectations for health care and rent prices remain unchanged.

2675,wallstreetbets,$NU Bank is massively overvalued at $40 Billion and is set to drop by over 90% ...here's why,"$NU is a classic case of inappropriately valuing businesses at a market cap that's exponentially way too high for them and is destined for a colossal debacle. I'm keeping this post short and straight to the point.

**NUBank ($NU) is trading at 110x of revenue, never turned a profit, and CEO admits to a struggling business post-pandemic.**

Let's put that in perspective, behemoths like Amazon trade at 4x of revenue, even SOFI trades at just 2.7x of revenue!

&gt;""**We were growing very fast up UNTIL the pandemic..."" - David Vélez, Nubank CEO and co-founder** **^(\[)**[^(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/buffett-backed-nubank-rises-in-trading-on-the-nyse-in-blockbuster-ipo.html)**^(\])****\*\*\*\*.**

NU Bank ($NU) IPO'd last month at a market cap of $41.4 billion, does 360 Million in revenue, and has negative 171 Million for net income (***has never been profitable btw***) and lastly, financial leverage is at 23x (*must note that banks usually have financial leverage in 7-14x range but 23x is crazy high*).

Let's look at some of the competitors to get an idea of how ridiculously expensive this company is:

The **largest bank in brazil** aka Itau Unibanco (ITUB) has a market of $36.90Bn and did $74Bn in revenue with positive 18.9Bn in Net profits for 2020! **They trade at 0.48x multiple, not even 1x.**

**SOFI** \- Market cap of 10.79Bn and trades at 17x multiple. And let's remember that SOFI is America-focused, $NU is not.

The following is not a competitor but it goes to show even single-digit multiples are harmful if enough people have their eyes on it:

**Peloton** \- Market cap of 11.23Bn and trades at 2.7x multiple. They are not the point of this article but I'm using it to rather demonstrate how ridiculously $NU is valued.

# Here's the icing on this cake:

Insider lockup for $NU expires May 1st, 2022 ^(\[)[^(source)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001691493/000119312521314359/d213207df1.htm)^(\]), literally \~5 months after IPO, usually IPO companies wait for like 24 months (or 12 is some exceptional cases). Insiders will very likely dump at the first possible sight because they didn't go public to raise cash (*they already had hundreds of millions from what they raised 5 months prior to IPO*), they went public to allow insiders to dump on the retail.

**This is the perfect recipe for a massive crash: business trading at 110x multiple with Insider lockup expiring soon, $NU is going to literally a $1-2 price range. Get out while you can.**

***Disclaimer***\*: I have\* ***PUTS on $NU with strike 7.5 expiring Feb 18'22***\*. This is not Financial Advice, do your own due diligence.\*",1641911529

Though it’s great that all of these issues are being highlighted to the public, it only becomes major news once there is a [huge oil spill](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/06/life-after-deepwater-horizon-the-hidden-toll-of-surviving-disaster-on-an-oil-rig) or a multi-billion dollar settlement or when [irrecoverable damage](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/24/louisiana-taylor-energy-to-pay-millions-oil-spill) is already done.

While there are 100s of [sustainable ETFs](https://www.ishares.com/us/strategies/sustainable-investing/esg-fund-range#climate) out there, most of them work on the principle of eliminating stocks that have a bad rep or reweighting in such a way that environmentally damaging companies get lower portfolio allocation. Adding to this, that extra 0.5-1% in expense ratio that ETFs charge will amount to [hundreds ](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/impact-of-costs#:~:text=return%20of%204.4%25.-,Expense%20ratio,out%20of%20your%20investment%20returns.)[**of**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/impact-of-costs#:~:text=return%20of%204.4%25.-,Expense%20ratio,out%20of%20your%20investment%20returns.)[ thousands of dollars over the long run](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/impact-of-costs#:~:text=return%20of%204.4%25.-,Expense%20ratio,out%20of%20your%20investment%20returns.)!

The strategy I have developed is to invest only in the most sustainable corporations in the world. The idea here is simple. You invest only in the public companies that feature in the top 100 list. Then we benchmark the returns that you would have generated investing in sustainable companies vs if you had invested in S&amp;P 500!

So the million-dollar question here would be: **Can you** **have your cake and eat it too?** Would your portfolio have to take a hit for doing the right thing or can you beat the market by investing in sustainable companies?

https://preview.redd.it/x7a5czo812b81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45bcca85e644d80cae3be188fa191481c7058c6a

**Strategy**

While there are many companies that rank corporations based on sustainability, I chose [Corporate Knights](https://www.corporateknights.com/)’ most sustainable rankings as the benchmark for my analysis. This is mainly due to these reasons:

1. They consider only public companies with revenue of at least $1 Billion \[1\].
2. They have been doing it for the past 17+ years which would give us enough data to understand how the long-term trend is going to be.
3. Finally, I found their methodology most comprehensive taking into account more than 21 KPIs which are all based on publicly-disclosed data \[2\].

One caveat here is that I am only considering U.S Companies in the list, as it would be much easier for us to invest in the U.S market when compared to a foreign market such as China/India.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y5lk1nra12b81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6afef568d0fa96a70a6f4a1932a8ac992c17fe7b

**Results**

You would have made a total of 155 investments across 56 different companies over the past decade (The same company can appear in the list in multiple years). The good news is that you wouldn’t have lost money investing in sustainable companies. The great news is that **you would have beaten the market while doing so**!

As you can see from the below chart, on average, the most sustainable companies outperformed the market by 9% in a 1 year period, and if you consider to-date returns, you would have made \~38% more than you would have made just investing in SPY.

[Investment return - Sustainable companies vs SP500](https://preview.redd.it/sm03iqbc12b81.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fef41f253252efae4eed1f0c2013378a2223cf6)

A more interesting insight is how ‘sustainable’ sustainable investing really is. If you are a long-term investor, the chances of you losing money on sustainable companies is virtually zero. As you can see from the below chart, you would have made lesser returns than SPY in only one year (2014) out of the 10 years in analysis.

https://preview.redd.it/2v7ul5sd12b81.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=504238886d6ec78f87d22f0fd19be6519a905aac

This shows that no matter how you look at it, sustainable investing looks promising and it’s not one or two outlier years that are skewing the overall returns.

**Some Caveats**

Before you try to replicate the strategy, you should be aware of some of the limitations of this analysis.

1. I am only considering U.S stocks in the analysis. For my friends across the world, you can filter out your country from the [top-100 list directly!](https://www.corporateknights.com/rankings/global-100-rankings/2021-global-100-rankings/2021-global-100-ranking/) Checking whether it will generate similar kinds of returns is up to you :) - You can [duplicate my tracker](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/most-sustainable-companies-2C2MtknvhSenYTUi4VXEjR/live) and just change the input stocks.
2. The returns shown here are not risk-adjusted. The alpha you are generating might be due to the higher risk that you are taking on environmentally-conscious companies.
3. There are arguments that sustainable investing is [just a marketing ploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd2D-0lQ36E&amp;t=111s&amp;ab_channel=CNBCInternational). There are companies (especially tech giants) that over-exaggerate their future plans of sustainable development to attract investors and get on the list \[3\] but might not follow through on their promises. I leave it up to the judgment of the reader to choose companies and rankings which align with their viewpoints.

https://preview.redd.it/gqh7bura12b81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c158619b9a70beacc9fd1a2476d9e6c1d94b11b

**Conclusion**

I started the analysis skeptical about the overall impact, because if you are investing in a standard index fund such as the S&amp;P 500, less than 3% of the index is contributed by Oil and Gas.

But as you can see from the below study done \[4\] by S&amp;P Global while creating the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index, more than 10% of the companies contributing to the S&amp;P 500 are being eliminated for not following environmentally sustainable practices.

https://preview.redd.it/tjb0zwyg12b81.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc62ff8954609870b7ec8b83b5f4726e94f9ce70

While there are debates about the overall effectiveness of environmentally sustainable investing, it does make intuitive sense to not allocate your capital to companies that are actively hurting the environment.

I thought that we would have to end up taking a haircut on our investment return if we followed through with only investing in environmentally conscious companies but as our analysis shows, we are able to beat the market by investing in the world’s most sustainable companies.

**This is truly one of those rare cases where you can have your cake and eat it too!**

2732,wallstreetbets,No need to overreact when buying companies with growth potential regardless where they are located.,"President Xi Jinping’s push helps redistribute wealth and opportunities more equally among its population, allowing the economy to draw upon a wider talent pool, Dalio said at a UBS Group AG investment conference on Monday. The campaign is often misunderstood by international investors, who fear the country is returning to the communist model under Chairman Mao Zedong, he added.

“First you get rich, then you make a point of distributing those opportunities in a more equal way,” Dalio, known as a long-time China enthusiast, said via video link. “The U.S., through its own system, needs more common prosperity, and a lot of other countries do.”

Dalio’s comments come as his support for the nation and its government recently brought criticism from politicians and caused tension with his own former chief executive officer, David McCormick, who’s considering a Senate run. In China, the move to address the country’s wide and persistent wealth gap has involved regulators targeting the tech sector in particular, alarming investors.",1641904409

2738,wallstreetbets,DD Shopify $SHOP: the biggest NYSE traded Ponzi,"Good day to you all and me. I have received a few messages asking me how I connect my statement that Shopify is a Ponzi to disappearance, probably, murder of the head of Shopify treasury, Brett O’Grady. Here I decided to connect all information that I base my statement on.
 
To not ruin the presentation I say my positions in advance:
 
A lot of puts 150-200 strike range Jan22 and some 160-300 range for Jun22 and Sep22. This company will go to 0. I am poor so my positions do not qualify for YOLO post.
 
Let’s begin:
 
Shopify “has” substantial growth of book revenue for the last 2 years.
Shopify claims that they have generated 1.12 bln. Revenue in 3Q 2021. They claim that this much revenue was generated by 42 bln. of Gross Merchandise Volume (hereafter - GMV) of all Shopify stores.
 
*Exhibit from latest 10Q:
 
“Key performance indicators, which we do not consider to be non-GAAP measures, that we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions include Monthly Recurring Revenue (""MRR"") and Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV""). Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies. The following table shows MRR and GMV for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020...
...Three months ended September 30, Gross Merchandise Volume $ 41,764,997”
 
There are some companies for comparison 3Q 2021: Coca-Cola with all subsidiaries - 10.4 bln. revenue, Phizer - 24 bln. revenue. Yes, Shopify says that Shopify stores selling yoga equipment or metal straws sold more than two companies from S&amp;P 500 combined.
This can be true: Shopify powers stores of Pepsi Co., Staples, Fenty Beauty, right?
Wrong!
Pepsi does not sell from its website, B2B only, Staples and Fenty Beauty do not have SHOPIFY PAYMENTS checkout meaning they are not part of revenue sharing plan, you can check it yourself.

Why Shopify payments is important? Because it composes 50% of all Shopify revenue or 75% of merchant solutions revenue.
 
*Exhibit from latest 40F
 
“Merchant solutions revenues increased $1,084.8 million, or 115.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in merchant solutions revenues was primarily a result of Shopify Payments revenue growing by $835.2 million, or 121.2%, in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.”
 
Formula: $835.2 /121.2% + $835.2  = 1,524 mln. Payments revenue of 2,021 mln. Merchant solutions revenue in 2020.
 
So Shopify is now a fintech company? If it is, it has the best equipment in the world that can generate &gt;300x yearly revenue of its book value:
 
*Exhibit from the latest 40-F
 
“10. Property and Equipment, December 31, 2020
Computer equipment Net book value $ 9,331”
 
Or rents the best equipment in the world:
 
*Exhibit from the latest 10-Q

“The components of lease expense were as follows:
Nine months ended September 30, 2021
Operating lease expense 16,041
Variable lease expense, including non-lease components 9,210

Really, it doesn’t. There are 10 000 employees at the moment. It means that IT company has 980 USD of computer equipment per employee. That means that this company only has PC for each employee and probably a couple of old servers for accounting department. That’s it!
 
The reality is that Shopify payments is a Stripe with Shopify logo on it:
 
*Exhibit from latest 40F
 
“We currently rely on a single supplier to provide the technology we offer through Shopify Payments.
 
At present, we have payment service provider agreements with Stripe, Inc. (""Stripe""), which automatically renew every 12 months, unless either party terminates the agreement earlier upon 180 days' notice. These agreements are integral to Shopify Payments and, at this time, any disruption or problems with Stripe or its services could have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial results. We have the ability, under our current agreements, to integrate alternative payment service providers for Shopify Payments. However, if Stripe were to terminate its relationship with us before an alternative payment service provider was fully integrated we could incur substantial delays and expense, and the quality and reliability of such alternative payment service provider may not be comparable.”
 
 
The whole responsibility for Shopify payments is on Stripe according to the contact (section 5, it is a bit long, didn’t quote):
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000119312515129273/d863202dex1011.htm
 
 
Despite that Shopify has no responsibility over payments and has no infrastructure it still recognizes revenue as a principal despite that in reality it is acting as an agent:
 
*Exhibit from latest 40F:
 
“The Company follows the guidance provided in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent in arrangements with customers that involve another party that contributes to providing a specified service to a customer. In these instances, the Company determines whether it has promised to provide the specified service itself (as principal) or to arrange for the specified service to be provided by another party (as an agent). This determination depends on the facts and circumstances of each arrangement and, in some instances, involves significant judgment. The Company recognizes revenue from Shopify Shipping, the sales of apps and Shop Pay Installments on a net basis as the Company is not primarily responsible for the fulfillment, does not have control of the promised service, and does not have full discretion in establishing prices and therefore is the agent in the arrangement with merchants. All other revenue is reported on a gross basis, as the Company has determined it is the principal in the arrangement.”
 
Note that Shop Pay instalments are not Shopify Payments. These are two different products.
 
 
Why it is important? (writing like Motley fool, lol, it is because they are publishing bullish article about Shopify every day and I read them).
 
It is important because even with abuse of Point-of-sale revenue recognition method for Shopify payments Company is still overvalued by PE metric.
And there are two ways to increase profit:
1.      To cut costs – impossible, because all costs are commission of Stripe
2.      To increase revenue – possible.
 
This brings us to the thesis why Shopify is Ponzi.
In order to show higher profit Shopify Inc. creates fake stores and makes fake sales from them.
There is a study published in Forbes supporting this statement:
https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/01/18/analysis-of-124044-shopify-stores-says-25788-are-fraudulent-or-dangerous/?sh=630d5ce73cd5
 
Revenue from these fake stores is not real but cost of sales (fee of Stripe) is real and Shopify has constant cash outflows from its operations.
It is surviving only by friquent SPOs: Feb 2018, Dec 2018, Sep 2019, May 2020, Sep 2020, Feb 2021 (see 10Q and 40F).
 
 
This brings us to the darkest part of fraud.
Shopify gets clear audit opinion. Cash balance is confirmed. Does it mean that if cash flow statement is correct and balance is correct then P&amp;L is correct?
Not neceserally. What is in the cash balance? 71% of cash is marketable securities:
 
*Exhibit from latest 40-F
 
“As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance was $2,703,597 and $649,916, respectively. These balances included $1,927,013 and $423,443, respectively, of money market funds, repurchase agreements, U.S. federal bonds and corporate bonds and commercial paper.”
 
 
And there are 2 ways how to get marketable securities:
1 – Buy them with cash
2 – Buy them on margin
 
Shopify got these marketable securities on margin because they don’t have that much cash. Auditors send confirmation request to broker of Shopify and receive an answer with open positions but without margin. Clear audit opinion is in the pocket. In quarterly statements no need for such manipulation because there is no audit. Cash balance can also be used as collateral or Shopify could provide a bank guarantee. There are many ways to get a margin.
 
One day head of Shopify treasury, Brett O’Grady, sees financial statements and asks the top management why margin is not presented in them (in liabilities section of balance sheet). (This is fine. I am responsible for preparing financial statement at my current work place and the head of treasury is my closest friend. He has never seen FS of our company despite that I send them to all employees of finance department. He doesn’t care because it is not his responsibility). After getting no real answer or answer that Shopify is committing a fraud.  And seeing that it is the reason why 20 executives left the company in the past 2 years:
 
https://timesnewsexpress.com/editorials/at-least-20-executives-have-left-shopify-in-the-last-year-of-enormous-growth-for-the-e-commerce-platform-heres-a-running-list-of-the-departures-and-what-theyre-up-to-next/
 
He calculates 2 + 2 and says something wrong.
Then Shopify executives make him disappear from this world. Leaving wife and his child:
https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/search-continues-for-shopify-exec-reported-missing-in-ottawa-1.5626544
 
There is no sign of violence. Bike is in perfect condition. He just disappeared. His father says that it is not in his character. Because there is no body homicide case can’t be open. To clear possible trace and avoid suspicion Shopify hires private investigation firm:

The U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.45%, the S&amp;P 500 index fell slightly by 0.14%, and the Nasdaq index rose slightly by 0.05%.

The minutes of the Federal Reserve's December rate meeting said not only to raise interest rates early, and to start reducing the balance sheet at the same time, triggering a surge in U.S. bond yields and investor selling of technology-based growth stocks. U.S. stocks have continued their downward spiral since the second trading day in January, with the Nasdaq sliding by 5%.

However, JP Morgan strategist Marko Kolanovic, among others, said

The pullback in risk assets in response to the Fed minutes was arguably overdone, policy tightening is likely to be gradual, risk assets should be able to cope with its pace and occur in a strong cyclical recovery environment, and it is time to start buying U.S. stocks on the downside.

Kristen bitter, head of Americas Capital Markets at Citi Private Bank, also believes that

In the Nasdaq 100, 38 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, and 65 stocks are down more than 10%. Now you can buy on a 5% or 10% pullback from those levels and get double-digit yields.

It's as if Citi's view was confirmed by the ""star stock"".

Yesterday, Tesla fell more than 4% during the day, but closed up more than 3%. The day, Tesla intraday amplitude of 7.7%. The market view is that Tesla is moving closer to the software company, following the price increase to $10,000 in November 2020, its Autopilot system has increased by 20% this year, a seven-year surge of nearly four times. Wedbush said that the paperwork for its Texas factory is all completed and it is likely to start production of the new model Model Y in the next seven to 10 days.

Meanwhile, chip stocks turned up in a collective comeback at the end of the day despite an early session plunge. Nvidia, one of the best-performing stocks last year, closed up 0.6% after falling nearly 6%, while AMD closed flat after falling more than 5%.

Amazon, which fell 4 percent to an eight-month low in May, closed down 0.7 percent, falling for five days to a three-month low.

Sevens Report Research co-editor Tyler Richey said geopolitical tensions and various conflicts and threats will remain supportive of energy in the near term, but it appears some supply and production disruptions are being resolved, so that could lead to a sell-off in oil prices on some news that is coming out.

**International macro**

1. Powell: The Fed will ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched

Powell said in his speech that the U.S. economy is growing rapidly and the labor market is strong. It can begin to see that the economy may be different in some ways after the new crown epidemic, and the pursuit of the Fed's goals needs to take these differences into account. To that end, the Fed's monetary policy must remain broad and forward-looking, keeping pace with the evolving economy.

Powell said the U.S. Congress has designated important goals for the Fed and given the latter considerable independence to use its tools to achieve those goals. This independence comes with the responsibility to be transparent and communicate clearly, to keep the public informed and to achieve effective legislative oversight. This responsibility is particularly important when the Fed must take extraordinary action in times of crisis. Powell said he would commit to continuing this practice if he is confirmed for a second term as Fed chairman.

2. The CEO of JPMorgan expects the Fed to raise interest rates more than four times this year, stock market investors or experience a turbulent year

Dimon said, ""We could have the best growth this year since the Great Recession and next year will be great.""

Damon said growth will come even though the Fed may raise interest rates more than investors expect. Goldman Sachs expects to raise rates four times this year, and Dimon said he would be surprised if the Fed did not take further action.

This comes after the U.S. CPI hit a nearly 40-year high of 6.8% in November; it rose 0.8% from a year earlier.

Economists surveyed by FactSet expect the U.S. CPI to rise 0.5 percent in December from a year earlier and 7.1 percent from a year earlier, which would be the largest annual increase since February 1982.

UBS expects U.S. headline CPI inflation to top 7% in December and peak at around 7.3% in January and February, before starting a sustained downward trend in the spring.

4. The New York Fed survey: U.S. consumers on the next year inflation is expected to remain at a record high of 6%

According to the latest consumer survey data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. consumers' expectations for inflation in the coming year remain at a record high of 6%.

5. ""This is not a healthy market"" - soaring U.S. home prices are attracting investors to squeeze out new homebuyers

His research shows that investors accounted for 26 percent of single-family home transactions in the third quarter, up from 15 percent a year earlier.

The cities with the largest increases in investment purchases - Atlanta, Jacksonville, Florida, Phoenix, Charlotte, North Carolina and Las Vegas - were also among the highest in home price gains, Zandi said. His analysis included data from CoreLogic.

6. Indonesian officials say coal export activity will resume early this week with the introduction of a new sales quota framework

Also earlier Monday, Indonesian Energy Minister Arifin Tasrif had told Japanese Foreign Minister Mitsuko Hagiota that the Indonesian government was expected to make a decision (on a ban on coal exports) in the next few days.

At the start of the new year, the world's largest power coal exporter issued an export ban as Indonesia's state-owned power company (PLN) reported bottoming out of coal stocks at domestic power plants, pushing up global coal prices while sparking protests from a host of consumer countries including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.

2793,wallstreetbets,U.S. stocks usher in earnings season What are market expectations?,"With all of this in mind, investors are awaiting the start of the fourth quarter 2021 earnings season this week, with BlackRock (BLK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo set to report their fourth quarter 2021 earnings on Friday, January 14.

According to Kostin's calculations, companies representing 79% of the S&amp;P 500 market capitalization will report year-end results between Jan. 10 and Feb. 11.

The market generally expects S&amp;P 500 earnings per share to increase 20% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 48% in the first quarter, 88% in the second quarter and 39% in the third quarter of 2021, in that order. If consensus expectations for the fourth quarter materialize, this would represent a step toward normalizing trend growth.

Among all sectors, energy stocks are expected to move from negative to positive returns. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, Materials (+57%), Industrials (+47%) and Healthcare (+16%) are expected to post the highest EPS growth, while Financials (0%) and Consumer Necessities (+3%) are expected to post little to no EPS growth.

2799,wallstreetbets,[Gann Theory]There be any cycle in the stock market?,"Absolutely, the answer is yes, but we can't apply a simple and fixed model to all stock markets. Each stock market is an independent viberation with its own cycle and development laws. Therefore, the cycle and law of the stock market will be introduced before presenting the text of this book.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the 1900's, economists in western countries have engaged in the study the law of the cycle, and all believed that there was a long-term law in the economic growth or recession. There is noting new thing under the sun.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1930, the American economist S. Kuznets proposed a business cycle applying to housing construction, with an average length of 20 years. This long-term cycle is known as the ""Kuznets"" cycle, or building cycle. C Juglar, a French economist, published his Business Crisis and Cycle in France, Britain and the United States in 1862. In this book, he pointed out that the capitalist economy fluctuated every nine to ten years, as generally called ""Juglar cycle"". Joseph Schumpeter took this as the ""medium-term cycle"", or the ""Juglar cycle"".

&amp;#x200B;

Edward R. Deway, known as the father of cycle analysis, believed that the most statistically reliable cycles were 9.2 years and 3.83 years. He was also the founder of many institutions studying the cycles. Edward R. Dewey (1895-1978) dedicated his life to study the cycles (not limited to the business cycle) and in 1931, he was appointed as the Chief Economic Analyst by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Trying to find the cause of the Great Depression in 1929 and 1930 in the United States, Edward R. Dewey established the Foundation for the Study of Cycles in Pittsburgh in 1940. The following are some graphs about the cycles proposed by Edward.

&amp;#x200B;

Business cycles can be categorized into long-term, medium-term and short-term ones. You may ask, is there any business cycle in the stock market or the economy? Let's begin with the stock market cycle and then we will talk about the real estate cycle.

The 30-year cycle is one of the cores of Gann's cycle theory. When making a prediction, the 30-year cycle can be divided in further, including the following different cycles.

&amp;#x200B;

• 30-year cycle

• 22.5-year cycle - (360 X6/8)

• 15-year cycle - (360X4/8)

• 10-year cycle - (360X1/3)

• 7.5-year cycle - (360X2/8)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o10zgsw1k0b81.png?width=1627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0c5e0d9e44a0818086962a80f89f895df3dbc30

If this 30-year cycle is applied to calculate the stock market cycle, you will get an amazing discovery . For example, Hong Kong's stock market crash in 1987 followed with another one 7.5 years later, namely in 1994, because of the upsurge of red chip speculation by foreign investors in 1993 and the United States' increase of the interest rates for 7 successive times. 15 years later, around the year of 2002 and 2003, the stock market underwent a huge decline because of the outbreak of avian influenza. In 2009, namely 22.5 years after that, HSI hit the bottom as a consequence of the financial tsunami. When it came to 2017, exactly 30 years later, HSI witnessed a depreciation in 2018 after experiencing the bull market.

&amp;#x200B;

When the 30-year cycle is applied to Shanghai securities composite index, there will also come something incredible. As shown in the chart below, the first peak after the establishment of Shanghai Stock Exchange occurred in May 1992. Following Gann's 30-year cycle, another peak appeared in the half of 1999, exactly 7.5 years later. 15 years later, the year of 2007 witnessed the climax of the bull market. After 22.5 years, the year of 2014 marked the starting point of the bull market in 2015. It is thought that the year of 2022, 30 years later, will be another high or low point.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Just as the old chinese sayings go that ""both people and things undergo great changes in a decade"", ""gold may become worthless in a decade"" and ""we cannot predict what will happen in a decade and don't laugh at poor people wearing rags"". These sayings point out the essence of the 10-year cycle. Juglar proposed that there was a 9 to 10 years' cyclical fluctuation for the market economy in his book Business Crisis and Cycle in France, Britain and the United States in 1862. In Business Prophecies of the Future Ups and Downs in Prices, Samuel T Benner stated that the highest point of trade price followed a repeated 8-9-10-year pattern. The 10-year cycle also plays an important role in Gann Theory.

Shanghai Securities Composite Index with a Cycle of 120 Months

&amp;#x200B;

Take Shanghai securities composite index as an example. After reaching a low point of 998 in 2005, the high point of the bull market appeared in 2015, 120 months (ten years) later. After the low point of 1,664 in October 2008, another lowest point came in 2018, 121 months later.

Shanghai Securities Composite Index with a Cycle of 52 Weeks

&amp;#x200B;

The above chart shows that the Shanghai securities composite index also subjects itself to a 52-week cycle. In the weekly column chart of the Shanghai securities composite index, the time interval between the peak in October 2007 and the low point is 52 weeks. After that, there will be return in every 52 weeks, either the peak or the bottoming out of the market index.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see the weekly column chart of the Shanghai securities composite index and take ""7"" weeks as a cycle. It is found that from the high point of 2015, there is a relative turn in a cycle of 7 weeks or its multiples, namely 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 and 70.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a coincidence or an accident for the above change in the stock market?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, one question. Whether the movement in the stock market is driven by events or the high and low points at the previous time point (cycle)? Therefore, China's stock market proceeds in a cyclical way. The turning point can be predicted as long as the right starting point can be realized.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a cycle for real estate. Although economists all over the world hold different opinions towards the research of the real estate market, but they serve the same effect. I will state the opinions of the following economists for your reference.

&amp;#x200B;

·Michael Hoyt, the author of One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago, studied the price of real estate in Chicago in a time period of 103 years since there were only dozens of wooden houses, and he found that its price cycles about every 18 years.

&amp;#x200B;

·Edward R. Deway, known as the father of cycle analysis, believed that each real estate cycle lasts for about 18 years.

&amp;#x200B;

·Fred Harrison, a British economist studying the real estate market in the Britain and United States in the past 200-plus years, found that the housing price cycled about every 18 years.

&amp;#x200B;

·Simon Smith Kuznets believed that the building cycle is 15 to 20 years.

&amp;#x200B;

It is coincidentally acknowledged that the real estate market cycles every 18 to 20 years. Starting from 1965, it is generally believed that the real estate market in Hong Kong has gone through three major cycles, the first cycle from 1965 to 1981; the second one from 1981 to 1997; and the third one from 1997 to now. The housing price often goes up or down along with the change of both internal and external elements.

I have mentioned the Hong Kong real estate market cycle in different situations. It is not difficult to draw a conclusion from the cycle of Hong Kong's real estate market that the cycle works every six years. Since 1997, great changes occur every six years, including 2003, 2009, 2015, and 2021. With Gann's 50% segmentation method, we can get that three years constitute a secondary cycle, namely in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

The change of the real estate market can also be concluded with the 18-year cycle, which has worked since 1985. Undoubtedly, the real estate market in Hong Kong goes up after experiencing the lowest point in 2003. Predicably, that the year of 2021 is likely to witness the completion of an 18-year cycle. Stepping back again, the rise of the real estate market in 2003 can be explained with the 6-year cycle mentioned above since the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1985.

&amp;#x200B;

It is likely that the upsurge of Hong Kong's real estate market will end in 2021, and then we should turn to the turning point that may appear from 2023 to 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

The economic cycle of U.S. stocks has a very obvious 7-year cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

\-In 1966, the United States experienced a ""credit crunch"". In August of the same year, the U.S. Treasury market suffered a severe ""liquidity crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

\-In 1973, seven years later, the world suffered the ""first oil crisis"", with stock market and economic problems and the first stagflation.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Seven years later, in 1980, Wall Street forced the Hunt brothers to stop hoarding silver , which helped some banks and securities firms to avoid bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

\-In October 1987, the Dow fell 22% in one day on ""Black Monday"".

&amp;#x200B;

\-Seven years later, in 1994, the FED raised interest rates six times in a row, and interest rates rose sharply from 3% to 6%, resulting in the most famous bond massacre in history.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Seven years later, in 2001, the Black Swan event of 9/11 triggered a severe setback in the global stock market, and the U.S. declared an emergency stock market closure from 9/11 to 9/14, but the market resumed on the 17th, the U.S. stocks still had a panic sale, the S&amp;P 500 index opened at 1,092 points and closed almost at the low of 1,038 points, down 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index was killed to 8,883 points, down 7%, and the stock market fell 14% in one week.

&amp;#x200B;

The 7-year cycle came to 2008, the financial tsunami, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks plunged.

&amp;#x200B;

\-In 2015, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks crash.

1, Powell: Fed will ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched

Powell said in his speech that the U.S. economy is growing rapidly and the labor market is strong. One can begin to see that the economy may be different in some respects after the new crown epidemic, and the pursuit of the Fed's goals needs to take these differences into account. To that end, the Fed's monetary policy must remain broad and forward-looking, keeping pace with the evolving economy.

Powell said the U.S. Congress has designated important goals for the Fed and given the latter considerable independence to use its tools to achieve those goals. This independence comes with the responsibility to be transparent and communicate clearly, to keep the public informed and to achieve effective legislative oversight. This responsibility is particularly important when the Fed must take extraordinary action in times of crisis. Powell said he would commit to continuing this practice if he is confirmed for a second term as Fed chairman.

2, the CEO of JPMorgan expects the Fed to raise interest rates more than four times this year, stock market investors or experience a turbulent year

JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon said the United States is moving toward the best economic growth in decades and expects the Fed to raise interest rates more than four times this year.

Dimon said, ""We could have the best growth this year since the Great Recession and next year will be great.""

Damon said growth will come even though the Fed may raise interest rates more than investors expect. Goldman Sachs expects to raise rates four times this year, and Dimon said he would be surprised if the Fed did not take further action.

Clarida sold $1 million to $5 million of the iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor exchange-traded fund on Feb. 24, 2020, and then bought a similar size of the fund on Feb. 27, the new form shows.

3, U.S. inflation data coming: CPI may run 7%, continued to hit a 40-year high!

This Wednesday, the United States will be released in December CPI data, the market is widely expected to continue the high fever of inflation, CPI growth is expected to rise to about 7% year-on-year, maintaining the highest level in 40 years. This comes after the U.S. CPI hit a nearly 40-year high of 6.8% in November; it rose 0.8% from a year earlier.

Economists surveyed by FactSet expect the U.S. CPI to rise 0.5 percent in December from a year earlier and 7.1 percent from a year earlier, which would be the largest annual increase since February 1982.

UBS expects U.S. headline CPI inflation to top 7% in December and peak at around 7.3% in January and February, before starting a sustained downward trend in the spring.

4, the New York Fed survey: U.S. consumers on the next year inflation is expected to remain at a record high of 6%

According to the latest consumer survey data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. consumers' expectations for inflation in the coming year remain at a record high of 6%.

Expectations for inflation over the next three years also remained unchanged at 4%. The survey shows that households are increasingly optimistic about the job market, with expectations for higher pay and improved job search prospects.

5, ""This is not a healthy market"" - soaring U.S. home prices are attracting investors to squeeze out new homebuyers

According to an analysis by Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, investor deals (including a much smaller percentage of property renovation investments) have pushed U.S. home prices up by an average of more than 20 percent, crowding out normal buyers. His research shows that investors accounted for 26 percent of single-family home transactions in the third quarter, up from 15 percent a year earlier.

The cities with the largest increases in investment purchases - Atlanta, Jacksonville, Florida, Phoenix, Charlotte, North Carolina and Las Vegas - were also among the highest in home price gains, Zandi said. His analysis included data from CoreLogic.

6, Kazakhstan's President: Terrorists may have caused economic losses of $3 billion in Kazakhstan

When we study Gann's theory and, in addition to macro and economic, we will also study the cycle of the stock market, that is, the cycle. the bullishness of U.S. stocks in 2021 is still overwhelming. What will happen to the stock market in 2022, what will happen to the economy in 2022, and what will happen to U.S. stocks in 2022? The U.S. stock market in 2022 or up to the seven-year cycle will have the opportunity to retrace, many people have asked, then today we explain again.

&amp;#x200B;

In Gann's theory, ""seven"" is a very important and mysterious number. Gann believes that ""seven days"", ""seven weeks"", ""July"", ""seven years"" may be the inner cycle of a certain stock. In the past, Xiao Long has successfully predicted the bull market in 2017, the bear market in 2018 and the Hong Kong stock market crash in 2021 by using the 30-year cycle and the 10-year cycle.

**Tesla** ([**TSLA**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) Chief Executive Elon Musk has defied big odds and consistently beat expectations since taking the helm of the electric-vehicle manufacturer in 2008. Now, with Musk having sold billions worth of Tesla stock and the company shattering fourth-quarter delivery estimates, is Tesla stock a buy?

Volume 0%Loading ad   
  

The stock sale began after Tesla reported third-quarter results that beat estimates, despite chip shortages and supply-chain bottleneck. Tesla is expected to report full fourth-quarter results later this month. Tesla earnings are expected to surge 168% to $6.01 a share for full-year 2021, up from $2.24 a share in 2020 and just 3 cents in 2019. Sales jumped 57% in Q3 vs. a year earlier to $13.76 billion",1641875549

(*Same thing with their other store Hollister*). Personally I hated that their idea of fashion was to have their customers become walking advertisements..

But here's the thing: their clothes are actually kinda cool now. They have thankfully adapted to the times and are offering a very inoffensive and trendy selection of clothing. It also isn't painful to walk into Abercrombie/Hollister as they are no longer perfume/fragrance infested dungeons (you know what I'm talking about.) They have also carved out an impressive revenue source from their online stores which I think has a decent moat based on their brand recognition (you can't buy Abercrombie/Hollister clothes anywhere else, Amazon etc.) and their free 2 day shipping on most items.. 

But most of you don't care about that. You're all wondering why any of this matters. Well, because fundamentally the stock is undervalued in key metrics that make me think the stock has massive upside. Let me just quickly paint the picture here:

**Current Multiples**

* 4x TTM EV/EBITDA

* .5x TTM Price/Sales - $1.8B Market cap but &gt;$3B annual revenue run rate
 
* &lt;5x Price/Cash Flow TTM - ($360m TTM Free cash flow!)

* Aggressive share buybacks - $235m worth TTM

* Extremely reasonable debt situation: 0.41 Debt to assets, 1.39 Debt to Equity

* Close to 60% gross margins (!!!!)

* 46% of net sales are coming from the online stores

* Finally but most importantly: **The clothes don't have their stupid logo/name all over them anymore and are actually fashionable.**

I think in a market with insane multiples on pre-revenue companies that value is a safe place to be, and although clothing retail is as boring of a sector as it gets, the multiples here cannot be overlooked. $ANF is undervalued. It should trade higher than the current price.",1641873127

I have a fantastic strategy that i do believe may work if executed with allegiance and fidelity among all members of wallstreetbets. 

The plan is really quite simple, all we need to do is go to our local grocery stores, and purchase every snack food that is there. Thats right, pile the bullshit snack food into your cart like a ritalin sniffing 12-year old, or a 65 year old man who just got an insulin pump. Doritos, takis, cheez-tits, whatever, buy em and HOLD! Thats right, retard, the doritos are the fucking move, and you better hold em. Tf? Why? Because the retards at frito lay, and wall street, are going to go ape shit with revenuewhen we are buying all the stock of all their chips and snacks around the world. Stock price is going to go NUTS over the new “chip craze”…. Well where are we gonna store our haul? Thats a fucking stupid question

Our wife’s boyfriends all have basements right? I mean where else would we sleep?

We will pile that bitch full of chips and save the receipts, and after we sell our calls, we will strategically switch to puts and RETURN ALL OF THE SNACKS, vaporizing profit for both the retailer and manufacturer. Maybe just the retailer idk. Go fuck yourself and have fun. I just emptied the snack machine at my school to get us started.

Since Ivy announcement we also had WEJO ([wejo click here](https://www.wejo.com/press/wejo-announces-wejo-neural-edge-processing-platform-streamlining-connected-vehicle-data-and-driving-autonomous-vehicle-reality-forward)) and OTONOMO ([Otonomo click here](https://www.edgeir.com/otonomo-nxp-partner-in-bid-to-leverage-edge-data-streams-from-autos-trucks-20211231)) launch a similar edge processing car platform. In this analysis i will try to provide my reasoning behind why Blackberry Ivy is the only platform that will survive this connected car revolution. Before we get started i want to quickly describe Ivy.

BB Ivy is a platform that sits on top of Real Time Operating System collecting data from car sensors (fuel, camera, lidar, engine, battery, etc). It then applies machine learning models/process to that data in real time on the car and feeds it back to the car services, like battery management system or other applications running on the car to make things for efficient. Example is, based on driver profile detection (video of user 1) it can tell how long range you will get with current fuel tank/battery charge. In addition this data is normalized and fed into the cloud into blackberry Ivy cloud console where app developers and OEM(car companies) app developer can use to make more services/app. to create better driver experience, stuff like maintenance or better insurance quote etc. So once an app developer makes an app, that app can be deployed to any car, any model, any brand!!! The app developer can make money and so does the car companies by allowing the app to be deployed on their cars. The IVY enables all car data to be combined so app developers can use it to make great apps/services.

So why do I think only Blackberry Ivy can meet the requirements?

**App from cloud needs to be scanned in cloud and in car before installing on car modules**  
WEJO and OTONOMO launched a similar edge(on car) processing data collection platform but they just don't have the security needed. With Blackberry Ivy it's not just one way data processing and collection BUT OEM/App developer can also update millions of cars with a click of a button. By updating cars with latest Ai code the car can become more smart and efficient. Blackberry ensures code pushed to car is scanned by Jarvis (DoD/NSA certified and best in class binary scanning tool) and Blackberry ensures that when the code gets to the car it gets verified with a key that's injected inside the car silicon chip. This is BB expertise.

**Real Time Processing Requirement**  
Second reason is real time requirement. Blackberry sits in 195 million cars and 24/25 top ev car makers are using BB in their platform. The Real Time OS allows blackberry to collect sensor data fast and process it in real-time. this is necessary because there's just too much data the sensors are producing. WEJO and OTONOMO runs on linux, it's not real time operating system so it will clog up everything. This is why OEM are deciding to use BB QNX for their ADAS and sensor processing platform. Without real-time BB QNX it's just not possible to collect gigabytes of data from sensors and process it in real time. The other operating systems will crash and get clogged up.

**Sensor data needs to be accurate before edge processing**  
Last is that BB IVY will have Blackberry QNX Backchannel ([here](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/blackberry-qnx-com/en/products/safety-certified/qnx-black-channel/Automotive_QNXBlackChannel_ProductBrief_30Jun20.pdf)) built into the IVY platform. Meaning all the data passed from sensor module to IVY to cloud will be encrypted and BB will ensure it's not corrupted/data loss/data insertions/repletion/etc. The data needs to be accurate and on point before the edge software can process it. Black channel ensures the data sent by sensor is accurate and has not be tweaked or no data loss has occurred. This is a big challenge for data scientist....IVY takes care of this on the edge!!!! Meaning the BB IVY won't clog up or crash like OTONOMO and WEJO. Latter two platforms don't' have blackberry backchannel communication technology, it's proprietary to Blackberry only.

**In the image below** i want to show where Blackberry IVY will sit for real time processing. It can sit on any operating system but it's recommended it sits on Real Time operating system by Blackberry QNX. QNX is blackberry proprietary and so IVY will be integrated with QNX. WEJO and OTONOMO is not compatible with QNX RTOS and will require OEM to do that integration or OTNOMO/WEJO will do the integration. This is why it's better/safer/secure to use IVY + QNX RTOS for data platform.

The green box is IVY sitting on top of QNX Real Time Operating System which is sitting on QNX Hypervisor (in 24/25 EV cars and in 42 car OEM around the world). You can see the sensors in RED sending data from different location in car to IVY through Black Channel Communication. This data is processed on IVY and pushed into other apps running in Android/Linux. Some is uploaded back in cloud for further processing and developing apps that can be launched on any car/model/brand etc.

This Ivy will eventually pass data to other vehicles V2X and smart cities through blackberry encrypted technology (Blackberry Spark SDK).

2972,wallstreetbets,SPYs path back to 480,"If you guys saw my post last week i mentioned how i believed SPY was on a path to 455. While as some will like to point out she did not make it to 455. I was off by 0.003% and she made it to 456.6 today. We saw an incredibly strong and bullish i may add bounce. Which allowed me to close 4 different puts for &gt;150% gains.
My feeling are today the market priced in the CPI report for Wednesday (though we should still expect a red day just not a -4% red over reaction day) and the leaked or new information that the feds will have to do 4 rate hikes in order to combat inflation this year (i believe that was a JPMorgan article but dont quote me). Anyways the markets were red af. Saw a massive sell off and a massive recovery today.

As i expected when we broke the 50 EMA support we would see a sell off to the 100 EMA. Truthfully i did not expect it today i was expecting it on Wednesday after the CPI. However we did manage to close the daily candle below the 50 ema today and wic all the way (almost) down to the 100 ema and bounce right on the support line of this 2 year long daily channel. 
https://i.imgur.com/DJ0w9P8.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/VVTn9oD.jpeg

What i will be watching is where we head tomorrow. 
Resistance and support levels will be key. 

we turned our RSI from 16 to 60 on the 30 min today and that MACD looking a little sus. we are breaching oversold territory almost.

support is at 464.6 (50 day EMA... another key area to watch as we did close a candle below the 50 ema) ---&gt; 457 (blue channel where we just saw a bounce today)---&gt; 455.5 (100 EMA)

resistance 466 --&gt; 469.5 (30 min 200 EMA) --&gt; 471.8 (daily 5 EMA... This will be a key level to watch) --&gt; 470.1 (we would need a candle CLOSED above 470.1 in order to confirm a true reversal).

despite closing a candle below the 50 ema and also wicking to the 100 ema we manged to finish and close above the ema. I would say its anybodys guess for sure where we are going BUT i see far more upside potential than downside.

my anticipation is tomorrow we recover and test the 5 EMA/ 20 EMA on the daily and get rejected (failure to close candle above) if and when that happens and the anticipated terrible CPI comes out Wednesday we will dump back to at or below the 50 EMA come Wednesday.

I think anytime today would have been a VERY good opportunity to go long on some 30 DTE calls (unfortunately couldnt cause no settled funds) but i suspect we will have another opportunity come Wednesday to go long on calls. If you went long on call today you should have seen some great rewards already.

I still see potential for another dip before recovery but for the most part i would not expect another dip below 460.",1641863350

OTONOMO Comprehensive Analysis,"So we had our big Blackberry Ivy (Intelligent Car Data Platform [click here](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/resource-center/videos/webinars/CES-2022-Investor-Call_PIP-Version.mp4)) reveal at CES 2022 last week. Lots of good stuff and demo ([click here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy)). Since Ivy announcement we also had WEJO ([wejo click here](https://www.wejo.com/press/wejo-announces-wejo-neural-edge-processing-platform-streamlining-connected-vehicle-data-and-driving-autonomous-vehicle-reality-forward)) and OTONOMO ([Otonomo click here](https://www.edgeir.com/otonomo-nxp-partner-in-bid-to-leverage-edge-data-streams-from-autos-trucks-20211231)) launch a similar edge processing car platform. In this analysis i will try to provide my reasoning behind why Blackberry Ivy is the only platform that will survive this connected car revolution. Before we get started i want to quickly describe Ivy. 

BB Ivy is a platform that sits on top of Real Time Operating System (RTOS) collecting data from car sensors (fuel, camera, lidar, engine, battery, etc). It then applies machine learning models/process to that data in real time on the car and feeds it back to the car services, like battery mgmt system or other applications running on the car to make things for efficient. Example is, based on driver profile detection (video of user 1) it can tell how long range you will get with current fuel tank/battery charge. In addition this data is normalized and fed into the cloud into blackberry Ivy cloud console where app developers and OEM(car companies) app developer can use to make more services/app. to create better driver experience, stuff like maintenance or better insurance quote etc. So once an app developer makes an app, that app can be deployed to any car, any model, any brand!!! The app developer can make money and so does the OEM by allowing the app to be deployed on their cars. The IVY enables all car data to be combined so app developers can use it to make great apps/services. 

&amp;#x200B;

# So why do I think only Blackberry Ivy can meet the requirements? 

&amp;#x200B;

**App from cloud needs to be scanned in cloud and in car before installing on car modules**  
WEJO and OTONOMO launched a similar edge(on car) processing data collection platform but they just don't have the security needed. With IVY it's not just one way data processing and collection BUT OEM/App developer can also update millions of cars with a click of a button. By updating cars with latest Ai code the car can become more smart and efficient. Blackberry ensures code pushed to car is scanned by Jarvis (DoD/NSA certified and best in class binary scanning tool) and Blackberry ensures that when the code gets to the car it gets verified with a key that's injected inside the car silicon chip. This is BB expertise. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Real Time Processing Requirement**  
Second reason is real time requirement. Blackberry sits in 195 million cars and 24/25 top ev car makers are using BB in their platform. The Real Time OS allows blackberry to collect sensor data fast and process it in real-time. this is necessary because there's just too much data the sensors are producing. WEJO and OTONOMO runs on linux, it's not real time operating system so it will clog up everything. This is why OEM are deciding to use BB QNX for their ADAS and sensor processing platform. Without real-time BB QNX it's just not possible to collect gigabytes of data from sensors and process it in real time. The other operating systems will crash and get clogged up. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sensor data needs to be accurate before edge processing**  
Last is that BB IVY will have Blackberry QNX Backchannel ([here](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/blackberry-qnx-com/en/products/safety-certified/qnx-black-channel/Automotive_QNXBlackChannel_ProductBrief_30Jun20.pdf)) built into the IVY platform. Meaning all the data passed from sensor module to IVY to cloud will be encrypted and BB will ensure it's not corrupted/data loss/data insertions/repletion/etc. The data needs to be accurate and on point before the edge software can process it. Black channel ensures the data sent by sensor is accurate and has not be tweaked or no data loss has occurred. This is a big challenge for data scientist....IVY takes care of this on the edge!!!! Meaning the BB IVY won't clog up or crash like OTONOMO and WEJO. Latter two platforms don't' have blackberry backchannel communication technology, it's proprietary to Blackberry only. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the image below i want to show where Blackberry IVY will sit for real time processing. It can sit on any operating system but it's recommended it sits on Real Time operating system by QNX. QNX is blackberry proprietary and so IVY will be integrated with QNX. WEJO and OTONOMO is not compatible with QNX RTOS and will require OEM to do that integration or OTNOMO/WEJO will do the integration. This is why it's better/safer/secure to use IVY + QNX RTOS for data platform. 

&amp;#x200B;

The green box is IVY sitting on top of QNX RTOS which is sitting on QNX Hypervisor (in 24/25 EV cars and in 42 car OEM around the world). You can see the sensors in RED sending data from different location in car to IVY through Black Channel Communication. This data is processed on IVY and pushed into other apps running in Android/Linux. Some is uploaded back in cloud for further processing and developing apps that can be launched on any car/model/brand etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

This will eventually pass data to other vehicles V2X and smart cities through blackberry encrypted technology (Blackberry Spark SDK).

This sub has ALWAYS had autists yoloing because ""Fuck it"" and ""Lambos or Ramen"". Anyone remember the cult following behind TSLA? We ALL made tendies - the true autists anyways. It had waaaayy more media hate than GME does now and every TSLA yolo was considered way riskier than GME is today. I remember the TSLA crash from 180 to $85 and I kept buying more like a true autist. Look at it today.. however, NO ONE can argue that TSLA's price today stands today on its fundamentals, not even a little bit. It's been all about retail sentiment and meme status. 

Regardless of you feel that GME today stands on its fundamentals, future growth, or meme status these are the facts: 

GME reported approx 5.2 million shares DRS'd by apes as of October 30, 2021 during their last 10q Q3 report. 

Current Reddit scraper counts 8 million shares as a low-end estimate of DRS'd shares today. 

AND.. DRSbot counts approximately 17 million shares DRS'd by apes as of today as a formula estimation of average shares and computershare high score account number. THATS &gt; 50% OF THE FLOAT! 

lastly, this week has already started seeing 30% price volatility.

Either join the movement and buy some long-term calls to add buying pressure to your bet or sit by and watch this one slip between your fingers just like TSLA, AMD, and MSFT,  which were all heavily pushed here in a ""cult-like"" way.

3072,wallstreetbets,The Ape Mentality DD,"Imagine if someone came to you and asked you for 1,000 dollars. You would tell them hell no fuck off (unless you're super generous) or you'd want a return if you loaned it out. (Keep this in mind)


Apes are WSB's best and worst event to happen to it **so far**.(I was into stocks but didnt know about WSB until GME)
People randomly bought a stock and believed that it would go up, and against all odds too. It went up and people made their money and even DFV held through the runs of it all. So what went wrong?


#Goalpost moving


For the next 12 months, apes would try to replicate what happened 1 year ago. Some people made youtube channels, started subs and made up lingos and words for apes to use for the newly formed cult. In my opinion, the orginal goal and thought process behind these apes is that they wanted Wallstreetbets to be all GME posts only.. any other play was considered ""distraction"" by traders who had no experince or idea how the market works. This eventually will come back to haunt them


Every time a theory fails the apes suffer from short term memory loss due to the amount of yelling in their echo chambers and they come up with some excuse as of why the stocks havent squeezed. It's with my best opinion that most of them have gotten used to blaming it on one man without considering the validity of their own comments and persuasions. The ""DD"" writers have become Self-Glorified idols to the apes and leads them in any and whatever direction they want to them


From personal experience, Apes work like this: 


•DD writer writes a EXTREMELY Long and Overcomplicated Article confusing apes and even normal investors.


•Apes look at TLDR or ask for one: ""DRS"" ""GameStop is the only Idiosyncratic risk"" (I've never used Idiosyncratic a day in my life and these people havent either, but all of a sudden everyone uses it now?) ""buy and hodl""


They aren't experienced and they aren't thinking about what's being said. That's why when you ask any of them about current speculation all they can go back to is that one page of the SEC report that they have been **TOLD**! That's right, they were **TOLD** they didn't even read the fucking report themselves. That the shorts did not cover although, on page 25 it says the shorts covered their positions. 


#Toxicity


This is breeding from 3 things: Pride, Narcissism and The overwhelming bags these investors are carrying. They have made mistakes **but Have Too much Pride** to admit that they were fooled or duped. It's easy to handle your problems when you blame someone else for the cause of it. It's hard when you have to look in the mirror everyday and see the fuck up that was your own doing by your own hands. They have convinced themselves that the little bit of money they put in will wield great rewards.


Its the mentality of a lottery winner, but these guys missed the call outs and still bought tickets that night expecting a 2nd call. These people have been infiltraded from Paraniod anti-vaxxers (AMC) to Qanon(GME) and their ideas of how the world and trading world works have been warped by mentally unstable grifters. They believe that everyone of us and everyone else is paid to downtalk GME and all of their other crazy theories when in reality, the people they go to are making money off them pumping and dumping the stock.


It's quite the spectacular event when you think about it. This is bigger than Heaven's Gate, there are hundreds of thousands of people right now who do not understand how the market works and will never invest in it again after it is done. The toxicty and angry behavior of these people comes from the denial of being robbed of a ""proper"" squeeze last year. Anyone who invests in these companies does not care for it, they simply are in it for the ""Moass"" and thats it.


A lot of these apes if not all of them are poor, none of them are making the income they need to sustain themselves. Some of them threw everything they had: Stimulus, 401ks, everything and never considered the possibility of them losing it all. It would be easy for them to just sell but Sunk Cost Fallocy and hope that the ""DD"" is right has them to believe that the stock will go back up and their investments im the stock will breakeven or if not go back up (see first paragraph).


#Enter the cult


SS is a cult reddit that constantly tries to pump the stock of GME by tagging revery time they believe that the stock is on the brink of a dramatic increase in price. They have formed a echo chamber where any criticism of the stock is banned, any criticism of the DD writers and DD is FUD, and every sub that doesn't follow these rules is ""compromised"". The only place you will see any DD writers are in their own echo chambers, they have to stick to the fantasy world or they'd get called out by reality in a heartbeat. 


This brings us to WSB where everyone here dlesnt care and tries to make a play. The apes feel like this sub should be where their voice is heard... but that's the only voice that they believe should be heard. This is dangerous for the sub and for anyone who is just getting started in losing money (lose money with class retard, not going down a cult rabbit hole).


I personally think it would take GME going down to 20 dollars for these people to realize they have been had. Even then you'll still have those too stubborn, too stupid, too narcissist to admit they were wrong. If you are in a society,  one great way to see who rules over you is to see who you're not allowed to criticize or question the rights and rules of.


For these reasons and many more, Im declaring puts on GME and I will be shorting the stock. (Vangaurd makes it hard for me to post here). My strike prices will go out 6 months from the current date and my puts are not for the company.. but for the batshit crazy ass apes that bought the stock and are trying to pump new bagholders in it out of pure greed.",1641855363

3082,wallstreetbets,Aberdeen International gearing up Hydrogen solution,"• Aberdeen International Inc. investee, A E S-100 Inc. (a leading clean hydrogen technology company) to develop transformational direct-to-consumer green hydrogen power unit for the common American home

• A E S technology positioned to save government and municipalities billions in infrastructure spend

• Anticipated development timeline to be approximately 50% of industrial sized application leading to expedited commercialization

TORONTO, Jan. 10, 2022 -- Aberdeen International Inc. (“Aberdeen” or the “Company”) (TSX: AAB F: A8H, OTC: AABVF) is pleased to announce that its portfolio company, A E S-100 Inc. (“A E S”), a leading clean hydrogen technology company, has initiated design and development activities for a green-hydrogen home power unit. This unit is being sized for applications to meet the needs of average North American households, revolutionizing green power production. The global addressable market for hydrogen is estimated to be approximately US$150 billion at present but is estimated to reach over US$600 billion by 2050.1 With nearly 140 million homes in the United States2 alone, the market opportunity is huge and transformative. A E S will initially focus on commercialization in states such as California with excess green electricity that is routinely curtailed. This curtailment is expensive to ratepayers. This wasted green electricity could otherwise mitigate the need for fossil -fueled energy that generates harmful greenhouse gases. The A E S technology provides a bridge between the day-time excess green electricity and the evening-time shortage, when solar energy is not available. This beneficial deployment of the A E S technology for home power will expedite green hydrogen as a viable fuel source, while stabilizing the power grid to permit greater penetration of renewables such as solar and wind. It is designed to leverage existing infrastructure, while saving billions in taxpayer investment, making it a win/win for both the government and public alike. The home power unit is much smaller - typically a few kilowatts (kW) in size. It does not require extensive scaleup efforts that are needed for larger units for industrial applications in megawatt (MW) size. A E S anticipates a much shorter development timeline for the home power unit, approximately 50% of the industrial sized A E S units. This means that A E S units offering green hydrogen to the home can be in the market sooner and with much lower capital investment. It will begin its beneficial contributions in solving the world’s pressing climate change problems sooner, and will also provide a valuable foundation for larger size industrial applications with a reduced risk for associated capital investment. “As a major shareholder of A E S-100, we like this fast-track approach to bring A E S technology from research to reality sooner. It promises earlier return on our investment at lower risk. We are very excited to see an accelerated path to commercialization,” said Mr. Younger, CEO of Aberdeen. As prototyping and validation testing advance, the company will continue to keep the market updated on the achievement of key development milestones. 

ABOUT A E S-100 Inc. A E S-100 Inc. is a venture stage green technology company focused on the development of novel hydrogen generation and separation technologies. A E S owns the exclusive rights and intellectual property pertaining to the A E S technology for the production of hydrogen.

(NEO: MOVE) (FWB:2K6B) (OTC: MOTNF) and 41.67% by Aberdeen International (TSX: AAB F: A8H, OTC: AABVF) with remainder of ownership being privately held.

3153,wallstreetbets,Markets vs reality (10 commandments),"1)Markets (the egg or the chicken)

A position is the egg. You either eat it today as (gains) or leave it to grow untill it produces multiple chickens and eggs in the future

Also be wary that the egg might crack / die (losses) and then you lost the chick and to be left starving yourself for the day

2)Markets (the hunting game)

The price is the prey. No one knows whats the prey next move. You may invest in best rifles on the markets, yet you dont hunt anything because of lack of  hunting skills.

All what we can do is set traps for the price. (stop losses and targets) or camouflage ourselves to get the best shot.

3)Markets (history repeats itself) 

All this technical bs is based upon the fact that history repeats itself.  If you gonna be stuck in history (technical analysis) you will most likely be stuck in the past. 

However historic data is good to educated ones self about the stock, or whatever you trade. 

Becoming a pro in history doesn't make a man a pro in predicting the future. Most likely, you will be hooked to look back, not forward. 


4)Markets (the power of now) 

The past does not exist, the future doesn't exist either. What only exists is NOW. 

The market is a luring time machine. It will take you back and forth thinking that you are travelling by time. 

The truth is that, time is the only variable. Every thing in this market is controlled by many factors (some intentional and some unintentional). 

5)Markets (fortune telling) 

The best two words to describe the scumbags who call me everyday saying that I should sell everything and invest in some shady broker in Colombia to become rich.


6) Markets (the thongs, caffeine and coco) 

I guess we all know. Nothing makes a man any happier than a straight line. Also a string is great. Best combo to over come fear and sadness of either not wining or losing it all. 

7)Markets (the mental war) 

Literally a fight between the cooked up guys and the guys on xzanies (uppers and downers) 


8)Markets (listen to parents advice) 

Do not listen to strangers or tell them where you at. 


9)Markets ( keep your friends close but your enemies closer)
 
Best described as the broker. The broker hates your guts. Your enemy (the broker), knows everything about you. The broker knows when you sleeping, when you wake up, your stop losses and your targets. 

Oh also i forgot to say, if they see you wining all the time. A computer catches your strategy and copies it. 

10) markets (the jungle) 

You on your own. If you dont know how to fight predators do not visit the jungle. I would say you can visit the zoo instead.",1641848602

scream 5 catalyst


this friday scream 5 hits the box office

an iconic cult classic

scream 1 rev 172m
scream 4 rev 80m against 40m budget

overall scream franchise 700m revenue against 140m budget 

now inflation means that's 304m in 2022



you could say the scream franchised was 🥛 ed to death but 
1 time passed
2 new director 
3 covid bored ness
4amc 🦍  might go see it to pump amc

full disclosure i bought amc at $38 and sold $100c weeklies for $1300 until IV died 💵


scream 5 getting good reviews from movie critics also has a new first ever version 3d release. 🍿 
50m budget  -con
wes craven died-pro new director
youtube trailer has 17m views currently
average  🇺🇸 movie  🎥 🎟 is 9.37 

thats 170m box office revenues if everyone interested enough in trailer bought a ticket 💰💰💰

easy to hit my 304m target if they bring a date 👱‍♀️ 👱‍♀️ 👱


will this impact revenue tho?


last q revenue was 6.61b


304m box office reflects a 4.6increase in quarterly revenues 
also the profitability of the movie is different from streaming where they operate at a current loss. over 90m box office sales = 🍗🍗🍗🍗 pure profits 
based on 60/40 rev split w theatres 



if this has a mega box office open VIAC should reflect some positive sentiment on monday for future earnings.

position 25x 1/21 calls 40

3219,wallstreetbets,Quick Lucid ($LCID) lockup expiry DD,"Wanted to share my thoughts on the LCID lockup expiry.

As growth tech and the broader market has been selling off for the last few days, LCID has held up surprisingly well for a mostly pre-production EV company. While RIVN, which is for all intents and purposes a similar company is down 22% YTD, LCID is up 3% after a strong recovery from last weeks bottom. I've use this recovery to load up on puts 2 weeks out for the share lockup expiry. 

**Share lockup expiry:** 

Wednesday, January 19th marks 180 days after the initial business combination Lucidand a cash shell company on July 23rd to form LCID. This is when 1.2 billion Lucid shares are unlocked to be sold on the open market, many of which belong to early Lucid investors who have thousands of % in paper gains. Lockup expiries can create substantial selling pressure. When the lockup for LCID pipe investors expired in September and 166 million pipe shares were released on the open market, LCID trended down nearly 40% in the two weeks preceding the lockup expiry on September 1st. The stock ended up recovering fairly quickly but still created a great opportunity to take profits on shorts and puts.

**The Saudis won't sell!**

Yes, chances are the Saudis won't sell. But they only own 1 billion out of the 1.2 billion shares that will be unlocked. That still leaves 200 million shares owned by others that can be unlocked, which is more than the unlock in September that created such a substantial drop. At an average daily volume of 74 million, this would create substantial selling pressure. Keep in mind many of the early Lucid investors have thousands of % in unrealised gains. As the music is beginning to slow for unprofitable growth companies in 2022 and with ate hikes on the horizon, many may be tempted to take profit, especially as LCID continues to trade at lofty valuations. 

Also - the Saudis own 1 billion shares. A simple majority of 51% ownership in the company would be 840 million shares. So hypothetically speaking, they could also sell a substantial amount of shares (for the purposes of profit taking or portfolio rebalancing/derisking) and still retain majority ownership of the company. IMO it's not certain that they won't sell - the Saudis are here to take money and taking some profits may be a smart move. 

I think LCID share price will decline significantly in the next 2 weeks leading up to the unlock date. I think ITM puts or shorts are a good idea if you want more conservative risk management. I have some profits to play with from the random VCRA spike so I went from some OTM puts, specifically the 1/21 35p. Proof of positions is attached below. 

As usual: I am literally clinically retarded. My mother drank and smoked cigarettes during pregnancy. This piece is intended for entertainment use only and not as financial or investment advice. For financial advice, please contact a certified financial advisor, which I am not. Options are extremely risky and volatile investment and there is a high chance you may lose all or most of your initial investment. Please conduct your own research/due diligence and learn the fundamentals of options before entering this trade. 

Disclosure: I own puts on Lucid stock, meaning I would profit from a decrease in the share price.

3235,wallstreetbets,Question regarding selling naked calls on RH to obtain massive leverage,"Let me start by saying I’m not asking for financial advice. If I choose to do this it will be my choice but I have a serious question regarding how selling options works for brokers like Robinhood. I’ve only ever bought options in the past. Never sold them. 

So what happens if I sell a naked call for say AMZN for 2024 strike price $3,300? Do they instantly give me buying power of roughly $53k? Can I then use that to plow into my favorite undervalued stock? What if I sold 100 of these? That’s $5.3 mil correct? I don’t think I’m retarded I fully understand that if the underlying that I sold the naked call against goes up in value I’m F’ed and same thing if the stock I’m plowing the leverage into goes down. I’m ok with the risks. It’s within my tolerance. 

Now if RH will actually allow this I believe it can work. I don’t have any worries of the stock I’m plowing into losing value because I will just keep selling calls and keep an open buy order to maintain the price. The only real risk I see is if the stock I choose to sell calls against goes up. I don’t really use my RH account anymore so I don’t mind deleting it should things go south and I already own a substantial amount of shares on better trading platforms should I feel the need to take profits.

The rest of the story is I believe my undervalued stock is a cellar box target but it’s also close to turning profitable and I think I’m running out of time to load up on cheap shares. The way I see it even if the stock I sold the calls against goes up in value eventually as long as the stock I’m piling into also goes up the same or more my margin requirements will still have me on the good side?

If anyone that has ever sold naked calls on RH could answer my question it would be appreciated.",1641841937

3349,wallstreetbets,"Take 2 Interactive, parent of Rockstar games, has taken a huge hit the last few days as a result of the ongoing Twitter campaign","I don’t sell or buy stocks. I don’t have the balls or the funds too. I read a book and took classes so I know some jargon, but I’m afraid I’m probably still woefully uneducated in the subject.

That being said, I am a huge gamer and play online regularly. One of my favourite games is Red Dead Redemption 2, and it’s online counterpart of Red Dead Online. It’s a game that launched 3 years ago and developed by Rockstar Games. Now, Rockstar has ignored its player base for much of that time, and things are finally heating up on Twitter.

The hashtag #SaveRedDeadOnline has been trending for a few days, and as a result, Take 2’s stock has plummeted 14.33% today ALONE, and was worth $181 5 days ago, compared to today’s $141. 

I propose that we (you guys, with the funds and balls), short sell this stock. It’ll drive their price down even more if a collective group focus on it, as well as the ongoing campaign that is not letting up. 

I want to harness and use the power of Reddit to create a huge change in the gaming world, as well as lining your pockets. It seems a safe bet it’s going to drop even further.

For more info on the campaign if you haven’t already heard of it, can be found on Rockstar’s Twitter page. Or just Google search that hashtag.

The smooth pink line is the 50-day SMA (SimpleMovingAverage), the white line is the 100-day SMA, the orange line is the 150-day SMA and the blue line is the 200-day SMA. If you scan through the price action over the last 1-year, we can clearly see the orange line as the main level of support. Today we broke below that orange line, which has not happened in the last 1-year. However, we are still above the blue line. And as long as we’re above that blue line, we’re in a bull market. Expect to see some support at these current levels. Keep your strategy bullish, for now.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

3465,wallstreetbets,"Carbon credit market. The biggest 'commodity' squeeze is gaining steam, slowly and then suddenly.","[$GRN](https://preview.redd.it/mr3d5xl7usa81.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94a8108a2c44fd3ea26e7f2519ba179ce555ed92)

Carbon emission trading allows for trading carbon pricing (the cost of CO2 emissions). Below is a very simplified explanation of the trade and by no means in depth. Carbon credits is one approach governments are using to fight climate change.  It works by setting a limit on the emissions produced by all participating emitters, a country or a polluter who produces more emissions have to purchase the right to emit more, countries producing less sells the right to emit carbon to other entities. This sets the price of the carbon futures market.  This system is designed to achieve aggressive emissions reduction targets.

If an emitter is producing more CO2 that allowed they are forced to go and purchase carbon credits. In effect they are short CO2 emissions and have to obligation to purchase it, at a higher price usually. 

The EU is entering a energy crises in this decade, they have been fucking around with green energy methods that have failed, Germany has just closed 3 of their nuclear reactors, opting instead to use fossil fuels and other dirty methods which further increase C02 emissions.

Adding fuel to the coming inferno is the fact that outside investors can also buy existing carbon credits, thus reducing what's available for sale to emitters who are FORCED to buy it back.

If you believe that emitters will fail to meet the aggressive CO2 targets and that the powers that be see it as fair to cause some pain if they do, then this trade is a no brainer. Betting that the price of carbon will go higher.

How to play it? There are numerous ETFs/ETNs that aim to track the carbon futures market. $GRN. $KRBN and $CRBN. The most liquid is $KRBN but it tracks EU and US carbon markets. $GRN tracks EU markets. They do have options but unfortunately there is piss poor liquidity.

I have been in $GRN since Feb 2021. Is it too late? I don't think so. Really the only way the price of carbon goes down will be with government intervention. European countries have made a clear that appearing green is a high priority currently. Eventually the price will squeeze to unsustainable levels and they will have to intervene but I think this will start looking like the charts of European natgas before that happens, running up 100+% in a few days. It is late in the sense that I believe the easy money has been made, but I'm more of a fast money type of guy, the last 10% of time in the trade will see the biggest % increase over it's lifetime. 

What are the risks? Multiple, this is a ridiculous instrument with **no fundamental reason to exist** other than to boost a few egos and images, but politicians are some of the biggest morons out there and this system is likely to be kept in place far longer than anyone can predict. Eventually they are likely to cry uncle and at that point it will be a great short. 

More and more people are starting to talk about this trade, Doomberg made a post about it last week which is worth a read. I believe the time is right to take a bigger swing at it. **Illiquidity, forced buying, governmental pressure, uncorrelated to the broader market**, this one already has legs. All it needs now is a bunch of retards...

Plays:

1. Long **$GRN** and increasing size this week.
2. Long **$KRBN** Jul15' 60 Call
3. Bidding for **$GRN risk reversals** \- I believe this is the best way and have put in some bids for risk reversals to see if they get filled. Governments have already shown they are happy with the current price so I believe the short leg is safe, effectively allowing me to buy the long leg for free.",1641826949

3469,wallstreetbets,I got a business idea for us Bulls,"With last week and today turning out the way they did, I got a business plan going for us bulls to survive.

As we all know, demand and supply are two major factors in a business, in a perfect competition, equillibrium get’s reached where these two parts cross, and you will get consumer surplus as a incentive for buyers who had a higher purchasing will. This consumer surplus can be minimized or even completely overturned into producer surplus (higher profit). 

The plan is that we spread out and don’t go behind Wendys to give handys and blowjobs for money, that will overflow the production, and the price will therefor fall accordingly.

If we instead build up a oligopolistic-type of a movement, where we produce the same product, with small differentiations, and in different areas, we can operate in a monopolistic-type. We can also agree on a cartell agreement where we limit our production of blowjobs and handys. this will limit the supply, drive the price up and therefore generate higher profit since our price is higher while our marginal cost is still the same.

The only thing I haven’t worked out is how we shall advertise.

So bulls, who is with me?",1641826784

3495,wallstreetbets,RANI will be the next moon ticket. ISIG AND EFOI found using the same technique.,"Here is the quick run down of RANI and what it does. So pretty much the company has developed a way to administer drugs orally without the need for injections. This is obviously useful for any drug compatible with the capsule format and is beneficial to anyone who prefers orally taking drugs due to fear of needles, etc. BUT THIS ISNT WHY RANI WILL FLY. KEEP READING TO SEE THE NICE LITTLE SQUEEZE THAT IS POSSIBLE.📷

Have you ever had one of those light bulb moments where it all makes sense? We have seen GME, AMC, ISIG, DWAC and others run to the moon and back. Well let me tell you the next runner. The ticker is RANI. Now, you are you are probably thinking why the fuck would I invest in this random ass biotech company. Listen to me…..I understand that Bio techs are a wild ride but after the evidence I present I think this could be and easy 100% runner. The analyst already have this ticker priced at 24-28 dollars a share. If you made it this far then buckle up for some no bullshit mind fucking blowing DD.

First off this ticker currently sits at around 200 on Fintels’ short list. This does not seem high on the list but wait until I give you some examples of recent tickers that sat same on the list then flew up to number 1 and 2. 📷

I am using the same method when I found ISIG after being shorted to shit as well as EFOI AT EXCATLY THE SAME SPOT ON THE LIST TWO WEEKS BEFORE TAKE OFF. If this runs I will be sure to release my technique on how to find these runners. So, first off lets take a look at the borrow rate. It is currently at a RIDICULOUS AS FUCK 142%.📷

Now, why would the borrow fee be so high when the “short interest” is so low? As with anything loaned out if the risk is high the fee is high. In other words, the true short interest has not shown yet due to the delay in reporting. We know that short interest is reported at the end and middle of every month. The ending numbers for December were not reported. So, I expect to see some outrageous numbers during Mid-January. After the stock was reported on 12-15 it ran over 20 dollars and you know damn well these shorts were loving the entry for their short position. However, there is plenty of room for a reversal seeing as the price was over 35 dollars in November and the FLOAT IS ONLY 7 MILLION WITH 4O FUCKING THOUSAND AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME. YES ONLY 40K A DAY. IMAGINE MAKING 40K OFF A 40K AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME TICKER.

📷 This leads me the my next piece of evidence. We have seen a significant increase in short volume within the dark pool which is another indicator that the whales are having a field day with this low float bio tech. 📷

Lastly HERE COMES THE BEST PART. **HARDLY ANY SHARES TO SHORT THIS STOCK.** 📷

So, with any uptick in volume the shorts will be shitting their pants waiting to see how high it goes before they have to start covering. To conclude, the company has a decent amount of cash on hand and no signs of dilution in the future seeing as they raised 42 million for their IPO back in August.

**DON’T LET THIS DD GO TO SHAMBLES. QUIT BEING A CUCK AND TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY.**

**I am not a financial advisor and these are my opinion. Do not buy based on my suggestions and do your own DD. I am only stating research I found.**

It doesnt mean stop doing whatever the fuck you are doing, it just means that you should be careful with over leveraging and becoming complacent.

If your stocks are up...its likely due to the market and macro conditions than it is from your ability to pick out winners.

I see the ponties in value investing attributing their success to their ability to pick out winners. Rarely do you see them attribute it to the broad market....or realize that they are betting on a company to execute.

In the secondary market, supply/demand based on the markets' perception of a company's fundamentals /other metrics is what drives price.

The 2020-2021 SLD / Future Rollover cycles all shared a common astrological transit: moon and Neptune.  

* Moon represents stability and safety. 
* Neptune represents deception, glamour (sound like our financial system?)

An astrological interpretation suggests that the next February cycle is when our tits will be fully jacked.  

**Astrological Events February 2022:** 

* Feb 16th, 2022 - Full Moon 
   * The full moon represents a moment of intense clarity.  
* Feb 18th, 2022 - Moon opposes Neptune - Also Feb monthly  expiry 
   * At this point the moon is as far away from Neptune as it gets.  
   * This opposition of the Moon and Neptune.  Stability is only achieved through seeing through the delusion of Neptune.  Expect a dip or some form of fuckery.  
* Feb 20th, 2022 - Pluto is at 27 degrees, 33 minutes of Capricorn, 
   * The last time this happened was July 4th, 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was signed.  Since Pluto represents rebirth and Feb 20th marks the end of the cycle that brought us the USA.  GMErica!  
* Feb 22nd, 2022 - Moon trine Neptune -  Neptune is fully supported by the moon.  
   * The glamour and stability join forces.  Literally we moon!",1641817838

They recently reported a large order for its size from an unnamed retailer that they described as one of the largest retailers in the world. It was an order for their E-Bloc product that helps manage multiple power sources like rooftop solar, and also onboard generation in case of a power outage. The article further mentions that E-Bloc can be used to make installation of EV charging easier and faster, and the equipment sold to this retailer had the necessary power capacity and components to run EV-Charging for the future.

3608,wallstreetbets,"Fed minutes, how to sting the nerves of the market?","On Jan. 5, the U.S. stock market fell in response to the release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes. $S&amp;P 500 (.SPX)$ $NASDAQ (.IXIC)$ $Dow Jones (.DJI)$

The core issues are two: **Rate hikes and tapering.**

If you have not understood these two concepts before (skip if you do) -

**Interest rate increase**, as the name suggests, is one of the most basic monetary policies by raising the U.S. is raising the benchmark interest rate in the market, thus making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow and further forcing the market to carry out an increase in interest rates as well. Its objectives include reducing the money supply, depressing consumption, suppressing inflation, encouraging deposits, and slowing down market speculation.

The ""table"" in the **Tapering table** refers to the Federal Reserve's ""balance sheet"". Although the Federal Reserve is the ""central bank"" of the United States, it is a private institution. If we think of it as a company, then the Fed also has a ""balance sheet"". Although it should not be understood in the same way as an ordinary company like $(AAPL)$, the Fed's balance sheet still includes assets and liabilities. And the action of tapering means that the Fed will reduce the assets (and liabilities) it holds.

Both of these actions are significantly **reducing the money supply in the market and lowering liquidity.**

**This time, the U.S. stock market led the global stock market to pee**

In fact, the Fed minutes don't throw out every word and every sticking point from the meeting. It is actually a very purposeful and appropriate addition to what the Fed did not express in full after the December meeting, or what the market interpreted as overly optimistic/pessimistic, **a deliberate additional message from the Fed to the market.**

For example, at the December meeting, the Fed's knowledge of the Omicron virus would obviously not be as comprehensive as it is now, and even if the Fed could speculate on possible measures by the U.S. government, it could not anticipate what other countries would do and react. The reaction of other countries, in turn, will affect another important factor - the supply chain, which is a factor that actually pushes up inflation in the United States.

For example, the Federal Reserve's description of inflation until December has been ""temporary"". Whether it is to give the Biden administration to save face or really this bunch of old-fashioned information lagging or not, this expression delivery is ""wrong and lagging"". So the Fed is eager to delete the original ""temporary"" expression, and to instill more aggressive expectations in the market, as an expression of ""correction"".

What we can be sure of now -

One, we see the contents of this December meeting minutes, **far more hawkish than then Fed Chairman Powell after the meeting statement.** The market plunge is ""fixing expectations that were not expressed in place"". Including.

The pace of interest rate hikes will be faster than previously expected at the meeting.

The rate hike will probably follow the tapering.

Of course, the rate hike will have a greater impact on technology stocks,inflation rising too fast will have a greater impact on large-cap technology stocks and growth stocks.

**Second, more than the interest rate hike, the stock market is actually afraid of tapering! Taper! Taper!**

First of all, why does the Federal Reserve want to shrink the table? How about looking at the Fed's balance sheet changes first.

https://preview.redd.it/fgbqqmwnwta81.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00d405c618bfda4017b09c4380603adbb1de927c

Obviously, this wave of ""expansion"" after 2020, directly from the previous level of $4 trillion to the current level of $8 trillion. The degree of water release can be imagined.

The Fed's table shrinkage in 2018 made the S&amp;P 500 honestly the largest retracement of the year since the 2008 financial crisis.

The Fed has a large percentage of U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, **and once it has to shrink its balance sheet, it will inevitably have to sell Treasuries and take money back out of the market,** thus reducing the liquidity of the market. Financial institutions will also have to adjust their risk exposures and liquidity accordingly, and will also reduce the proportion of risky assets (such as stocks), so the impact on the stock market is very direct.

**At the same time, the faster ""tapering"" is expected to enhance the ""signal effect"" .** At the current zero interest rate floor, the effect of ""expansion"" will be ""significantly enhanced"", while when interest rates are well above zero, the effect of expansion is not obvious.

This concept appears in St. Louis Fed President Bullard's 2019 study, ""When Quantitative Tightening is Not Tightening. It is simply understood as a form of market ""expectations management"" (forecasting). Obviously, this anticipation is more pronounced in the stock market.

**Why did the Fed go to such lengths to warn the markets?**

It must be trying to shake things off - don't blame us for not warning you when the time comes!

Of course, the Fed is seeing the risks.

**First, its inflation target has been reached, the monetary policy is now to catch up with inflation and accelerate the ""normalization of monetary policy"".**

In fact, it also shows that the Fed is not a ""prophetic"" organization, but more in line with the changes in the market. And, in today's increasingly rapid transmission of information, the old guard may receive feedback from the market is increasingly slow. Only 2021 exceeds the expected inflation will be enough for them to mention a few pots.

**Second, political pressure to influence their statements**

Democrats in power, often in the funding to open wide, Powell since it is to the Biden administration, naturally to take care of their face. Coincidentally, the current Secretary of the Treasury is the previous Federal Reserve Chairman Yellen, and Powell and Yellen used to work together for so long, many policies heart to heart, but also more convenient to pass gas. Therefore Yellen's attitude, but also expressed some of the Fed's helplessness.

For example, **the recent Yellen repeatedly shouted ""lower tariffs"", the main purpose is to alleviate the logistics problems, supply shortages and rising demand brought about by rising prices.**

Because the Fed does not have many tools at hand, and without the assistance of fiscal policy, many monetary policy will be greatly reduced.

**Final tips**

First, liquidity in the market must be lower and the liquidity tightening must be no better than in 2018!

Second, **few fund managers in the market have experienced the economic cycle in its entirety,** and many institutions have no idea what a rate hike environment looks like.

And the current market is dominated by quantitative, everyone moves surprisingly consistent, which can also explain why the end of January 5 can deflate so quickly.

So, the situation that we are facing now is probably brand new in 10 years.",1641806701

Hey community :)
I would like to apologise for my English. English is not my mother tongue.
As the title says, I have 250 dollars per month which I would like to invest. I have read up on different sources, but now I want to get your opinion as well.
I am currently studying and have a student job. I can put aside about 250 dollars every month, but I don't want to just leave the money lying around. Where would you invest if you could pay 250 every month?
Should I split this up and, for example, put 100 in coins and 150 in shares every month? The money is dispensable for me and I see it as a mixture of investment and learning money. So the risk may also be rather high.
I am grateful for any suggestions and further investment ideas :)

Did you know that if you don’t leverage you won’t get stop lossed if you don’t want to? ;) you can hold forever! let that sink in. 
For real: this is for all the young new investors: it’s better to get small to medium gains than to loose it all. You still can yolo a % in the big gambles and be happy if you win and you can be „happy“ if you loose too cause you didn’t crashed it all.

BUT

For fucks sake - i just have one simple question i really would like to have finally answered - but because some not explainable reason everyone (people and resources) give me different answers so since the real option players are you guys - please enlighten me so one day i can give back to you with more loss porn.   
So, lets say i buy a call option - for example we take a TSLA $950 Call which expires 3 months from now on. From what i get - i can excercise this option whenever i want until expiration and buy a premium. Quite easy. 

1.) IF i exercise - where do i get my shares from? Do i get it from a broker or from the person who sold the call to me?(and if later - does it affect the outcome in any way?) or from the institution / person who first off wrote the call?   
2.) If i sell this call 1 month later and whoever buys it exercises it. Do I get assigned and owe shares or the one who firstly wrote that option? Because if i would be assigned - i would only want to sell options which will always expire worthless and never get exercised to just keep the premium, right? 

If anyone was to bear with me and help me out - thank you in advance. I can be of service behind the next wendys for your time.",1641799721
3638,wallstreetbets,A slightly better investment idea (than withdrawing 100$ and microwaving in Hilton),"Reading about the two recent (very solid tbf) investment ideas here got me thinking… there is one which could actually work, if we all (or many of us) participate. Here it is:

There are many online shops which offer free returns within 30 days. So here’s what we do:
- we choose a shop that is listed on an exchange and we short it (doesn’t have to be Amazon as they are probably too big for this to work, but something like zalando (European fashion store) or Wish could do
- we all order something, many things, that qualify for free returns
- after a few days, everyone returns the items
- repeat as long as the shop allows it. 

Needless to say, this will generate huge costs for the shop, thus driving down their profits. 
Depending on the shop and their shipping method for the free returns, we could also buy calls on the shipping service providers. 

Advantages of this strategy: 
- You don’t loose money on the operational part (unlike renting hotel rooms)
- you can do it from home
- you get to check some shit out that you ordered, post some pics on Instagram and make your wife’s bf jealous, before you return it. 
- it’s basically legal 

What are the Risks?
- the only thing I can think of is that the shop turns this thing around and presents it as a huge increase in their revenues, at the same time downplaying the costs of returns. In a Bull market this could cause retail to buy the stock. Institutional investors should see it through though. And we are not in a bull market anymore anyway.",1641799616

Like most weekends when I am bored I wonder into the rabbit hole of stocks and what major wealth or fund owners purchased.  Today I stumbled upon the bill melinda gates foundation trust.  Now I don't know why and maybe people can help me understand why the gates are interested in BBQs. 

Link below of filling: 

https://fintel.io/so/us/webr/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-trust  


This form was filed on 2021-11-15 for the ereporting period 2021-09-30 and it shows them holding 2,500,000 shares of of WBER.  


Website below:

https://www.weber.com/US/en/home/  


Do they know something we don't, will the summer of 2022 be the biggest demand of BBQ grill as everyone is going to return to weekend BBQs?  Is the supply chain of Chinese BBQ not going to make it to the USA? I find this highly suspect that this one specific company that is directly focused on BBQ and BBQ supplies gets bought by one of the biggest trusts in the world. 

The fund is holding almost the same amount of shares of Microsoft as it is of Webers.  So can someone make sense of it for me?  Or did they buy this to lose money as a form of a write off.

Someone please poke a hole in this strategy for retail to kick things into high gear (beyond the obvious “most apes don’t have the capital to exercise”; there are a lot of lurker whales out there):

1.	⁠Buy 0dte ITM/ATM calls the afternoon they are due to expire for next to nothing, so you’re not paying a premium for time value (relative to just buying shares)
2.	⁠Exercise before market close (no need to fear your broker jumping the gun and auto-exercising for you; you bought these calls with the intention of exercising) 
3.	⁠Wait T+2 for shares to settle
4.	⁠Either DRS the shares, or sell them on the upcoming Friday and repeat by buying and exercising more 0dte calls
5.	⁠

6.	⁠Profit?????

The rationale behind this is that some stonky dudes are saying that exercising calls results in quicker forced delivery of shares versus just buying shares.

This years gourd yield will be smaller than years past due to deteriorating soil conditions, corona and warmer-than-average winter within Central Mexico.

Many agricultural experts are forecasting the next gourd crop to be smaller than a micro-penis getting sucked behind Wendy's. 

Given how corona rocked the ornamental gourd world last year farmers are hesitant to plant this crop.  

Ornamental gourd sales are expected to peak through Halloween and have strong sales up to Thanksgiving as families decorate the table.   

Omicron blowing through the population is bullish as fuck for gourd sales.  Herd immunity will ensure families feel comfortable going trick-or-treating and having Thanksgiving get togethers.  

Beyond all this the soil conditions almost ensure gourds will be much much smaller than years past.  This means that the price per pound is going way fucking up.   💲💲💲💲🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

To play this properly just start buying gourds like a mad ape starting in August.  This is quite the opportunity for a life savings YOLO.  Small gourds and fewer of them plus huge demand = tendies.  You can even allegedly claim you own a farm for tax purposes and you know the government is handing out subsidies faster than they distribute crack.  Just make sure to sell your gourds for much higher prices into Halloween and Thanksgiving for a multiple of what you paid.  Otherwise, you will be softer than a rotten gourd and your wife's boyfriend will be very unhappy with what you are doing for him.

Gourd mania can be bigger than Tulips, Beenie Babies or digital tokens.   

TLDR: Yolo gourds, make huge profit.  It's time to get 10,000x profit when we cause mass hysteria.",1641791202

Feels good to read them. 🚀🚀🚀,"We’re trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done but we believe we’re putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the longterm. The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on these goals at all times.

We know some people want us to lay out a whole detailed plan today, but that’s not gonna happen. You won’t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition. That’s the philosophy we adopted at Chewy.

Here are a few things we’ve done so far: refresh the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthened the balance sheet, and begun laying the foundation for long term growth.

Moving forward, we want you to judge GameStop based on our actions, not our words. Thank you everyone, and as my dad would say, “buckle up.”",1641781317
3731,wallstreetbets,The Ultimate Fool-Proof Investment strategy that everyone will win in the End,"Hear me out-

Airplanes overbook by 20 seats at a time. If they can’t get you seat in a flight within 4 hours they have to pay 4x the amount they charged you for the ticket. 

So let’s say we all find a flight that leaves at the same time every day and has no flights afterwards. 

If we all pile on and buy those tickets we can easily get them to oversell and then there would be no flight within 4 hours thus meaning that they have to give us 4x our ticket investment. 

Bam! Instant 4x profit for 20 of us. 

As for the rest who buys tickets, they will short the airplane stock and the 20 of us will use our 4x profit to short it as well. 

Then the 20 of us will start complaining and telling everyone at the gates that we were scammed out of our flights because they were overbooking and this will then cause mass panic amongst travelers on that airline. 

Then we get the news in on it and then bam, investors start getting scared and start seeing everyone buying puts and then we all profit so fucking much I don’t even know what we’re gonna do next. 

Then rinse and repeat until all airlines stop overbooking entirely or until we all create generational wealth. 

TLDR: Lets buy overbooked flights to get 4x profit on our tickets and short the company at the same time to get 10,000x profit when we cause mass hysteria.",1641780946
3732,wallstreetbets,COST - Could the antiwork movement work in Costco’s favor?,"Hi all,

Over the past few months there’s been a mass exodus of retail workers leaving and retailers having a hard time replacing them. Most of the stores I go to are well understaffed with aisles either being barren or got shit scattered all over the place.

Costco is one of the exceptions. All the aisles are stocked up &amp; organized, no hiring ads in slight, and the staff don’t look dead inside. This is probably due to the fact that unlike most retail companies they seem to treat their employees slightly better than cattle. 

Now while there’s other factors impacting stores such as the Alphawifesleeper variant goofing up the supply lines like the other ones, I feel like Costco not having employees texting resignation letter to get Reddit points will help them get ahead of their competitors as this goes on. Even thought it’s still near it’s ath, they still got room grow and continue to increase their marketshare  over stores still struggling to staff people and providing a crappier experience as a result.

3747,wallstreetbets,I got a solution for inflation,"So first I should inform you guys I’m not an economist. I’m more of what you would call an “idiot”

I believe I figured out how to solve the inflation problem without raising interest rates or tapering. Raise the minimum wage to 30$/hr. This in theory should create mass unemployment. With more people being unemployed that should slow down the velocity of money. 

Most people making &lt;30$/hr would support this because they think that means they would get a raise. In reality they would likely get fired because employers would either figure out how to more quickly automate or only keep their most productive employees. I’m actually surprised some jobs even exist or have as many people doing it because is pays so little. The Walmart greater, or cashiers. You don’t need the greeter and self check out already exists but for some stores it currently isn’t worth paying to buy the new machines. If they had to pay 30$/hr per employee it would be worth buying the new machines and just pay 1 employee to watch 4 lanes. This is one example that comes to mind.

With less people employed, less people with money to buy things, there will be less demand. No more supply shortages, no more labor shortages and we’ll reach equilibrium again. 

I figure this would be the best solution since it looks like no one likes raising rates since makes credit more difficult and makes industry less willing to invest in new tech. Plus the government doesn’t want to increase cost of servicing their own debt. Another idea would have been to raise taxes but fuck that. So this idea of causing unemployment through this method would be more palatable to everyone. Plus i think it would give the added benefit of forcing our economy to be more efficient.

**The value of the trade - Pre 1960’s**

Before the 1960s, if you were a male you graduated high school, got your GED, dropped out to smoke weed with your friends and go to rock concerts, etc. Those that graduated/GED went into a trade, got a girlfriend,  making good money, drinking a bunch of beer, buying a house, having a family, life’s good right? Life is easy when it’s simple, you got your wife in the kitchen making your sandwiches and getting your beer, taking your anger out on your kid, your mortgage rate is kind of high but your down payment was cheap as fuck and it’s going to appreciate like a mother fucker for the next 60years just you wait. Now, those who didn’t graduate and dropped out spent all their time and money doing coke at rock concerts, getting DUI’s, fucking groupies, dropping acid, etc. They accumulate some debt, do this for 5-10yrs, now they sober up after one of their friends hits a car and drives into a tree while drunk driving killing themselves, their friend and the people in the car that they hit. What do they do? They go into a trade. They are making good money, sobered up, pay off their debts, buy a car, get a girlfriend, buy a house, their life is back on track. The value of the trade lied in its respectability, its necessity and its pay. People still got degrees back then, but you were largely criticized for being a nerd, not having street smarts, not paying your dues, etc. I mean for what it’s worth, why pay for experience with your head in a book when you can get paid for the experience and learn with your hands like a real man?

**The value of the degree - 1960 - 2009**

I’m not going to go into a history lesson about the 1960’s because everyone knows what happened. I will sum it up by saying it was a cultural and educational renaissance for the US. The movement’s drove people to Colleges and Universities, the increase in demand made new institutions pop up around the US which drove more students to seats since education became more available, etc etc. Now the boomers are starting to see these bookworms come out of college making their trade wages if not more while they get to work in a climate controlled office, not have to be under hazardous work sites, etc and they begin to wonder if the trades are really the right thing to do for their kids. They begin to push college on them. This narrative of “go to college, you don’t want to work with your hands” will be pushed across the US for years, essentially demonizing the trades. A once respectable profession is now associated with the low class and low IQ. Salaries for employees with bachelor's starts to accelerate and at this point don’t even need to have a relevant degree for your position, the fact that you have one is the key.

2009, again I won’t go into a history lesson but if you were alive during this period you know that those who lost their jobs in the 2008 financial crisis went back to school to either get their BS or their MS. This on top of the already accelerating college enrollment, plus the now crippled US economy bursts the value of the degree. The BS is as common as a Dunkin Donuts in Massachusetts or a -40% in an ARK fund. Salaries stagnate or decrease, inflation increases, college costs increase, it’s a mess for the undergraduate bag holders.

2021, ONCE AGAIN, I will not go into a history lesson because we were all there. Covid happens, everyones locked down, colleges go remote, tuition remains the same. What the fuck is the point of college? You can’t party, you can’t afford it and even if you can your paying a house downpayment to watch youtube videos of your professor and take tests via Zoom, even if you do decide to go to zoom university when you get out you’re going to be using your diploma as rolling paper before you go to your shift at Wendy’s. There’s just no point, and we can see it in the numbers. The trades are becoming more necessary, while BS salaries are flat/decreasing trade wages are increasing at rates that make a BS holder look retarded.

This is where i’m going to get speculative. I believe we will keep trending downward in awarded BS degrees. It currently makes no sense for a HS graduate to consider college(minus a few degrees) when trades are paying much more and tuition is so high. HS graduates will trend towards the trades, maybe get some vocational trading, and start life off with a good salary and no debt. Already better off than a BS holder. Even though BS salaries flattened during the college boom, in a lot of industries the needs were never fulfilled. Now that potential college students are going away from college, those needs will never be met. Employers were getting away with very low salaries due to supply and demand of BS holders, but I don’t think the supply was THAT far away from the intersection point to demand that low of salaries. I believe that with tuition and loan costs going so absurdly high, college graduates became less confident in themselves and wanted to start paying them off asap so rather than negotiate they accepted the first offer given. This going on a yearly basis accelerated the deflation of the college degree. Between 2021-2022, the “Big Resignation” occurred bringing that confidence back to the BS holders. Between 2022-2026, the supply and demand curve for the BS degree will go far below the intersection point. Salaries will explode, and I mean EXPLODE in the already exploding fields like Computer Science, IT, Medicine, Nursing, Healthcare, etc and explode to a lesser degree in the other sectors. But finally we are at the point of this post, and i’m talking about Computer Science, IT, Medicine, Nursing, Healthcare salaries exploding so high that it will cause another bubble like the dot com bubble.

For obvious reasons, the effect of Covid on tall these professions will not slow down their accelerated need in our society. It will be around forever, hospitals will be exceptionally flooded periodicity because they are normally flooded due to their already lack of employees. Technology will continue to be the back bone of the US and their need is accelerating just as fast as medical. Starting salaries will increase by 15-20% every year. In both medicine and tech, people will job hop every year to take advantage, which will artificially increase salaries of said employees by getting them to hopefully stay. Competitors will take on the annual increase on top of the artificially increased salary and job hop again, and you now have the first salary bubble ever recorded. You apes who have GME shares, you’re going to wish you had a piece of paper saying you went to school to learn about peoples genitalia or actual rocket ships because this is going to be a squeeze in a form we have never seen. I’m a SWE with 2.5yrs of experience, I get calls on a daily basis and i’m a fucking shit developer. I WFH and do MAYBE 4hrs of work a day and get paid 95k a year. I’ve been at my job for 6months and have started taking interviews so I can jump to 125k when I hit 1yr(I know my current company won’t be able to match that). I also think Covid has pumped a fuck ton of money into Pharma and their labs will also be apart of this bubble. Bio, BioTech, BioStats will all become apart of the wanted. Do you think these big pharma companies are going to let 2019-2022 be a quick bubble in their balance sheet? Um no, they are going to want the same acceleration in revenue they saw during covid in the 2022-2026 time frame. How do they do that? The google strategy, throw a fuck ton of money at the wall and go with what sticks. The bio group was apart of the ones who were artificially suppressed in terms of salary but now they will watch their salaries explode. Big pharma needs to act quick to figure out how to invest their vax money to get covid like returns. Everyone will make a ton of money from 2022-2026 until it implodes in 2026-2027. Big Pharma won’t be able to legitimately maintain current returns, hospitals won’t be able to afford their staff, companies won’t be able to maintain their software with everyone leaving every year and their sky high comp… The biggest bubble since the dotcom bubble will then burst.

Been seeing a whole lot of loss porn recently. Want to add a couple of observations that might help going forward. Post will be fairly short.

1. **Savings**. American excess money in savings are gone. Literally gone. Easy money in shit stocks is likely to not work. Credit card rates are rising - people need money, and speculative stocks are the first to go. Note: this only applies to small cap tickers.
2. **Trapped Longs.** Trapped longs sell rips. If your stock has excess inventory trapped above for an extended period, do not expect a miraculous rebound. WISH is probably the world's best example of this, but many stocks fit this bill, even the beloved GME. 

**American small retail players are out of cash**

Not sure why this is not more in the news. **Savings just recently finally fell** **BELOW** [pre-pandemic levels](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PMSAVE) right when the FED money printer is turning off.

Credit and loans are spiking. No coincidence. People need money.

**What about muh stonks**

A lot of stocks recently have tons and tons of trapped longs because either insiders sold, it IPO'd too high, or it's just a shit company. A lot (like most of the tickers on this sub) look like this. I'm here to tell you it's not coming back. Here's WISH as an example - make sure to thank Zack Morris for this beautiful chart. The perfect short. 

[WISH](https://preview.redd.it/dcfrky8h9ra81.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787532de6d84029aeb2dac1e8e742d9f17066085)

This is literally everywhere, CLOV, BABA, TLRY, PLTR, even your beloved GME and AMC. They didn't fade on Friday because of hedge funds. They faded because people took the higher price to sell out for break/even. 

The solution for you, WSB reader, is to pick stocks that don't have a mountain of bag holders above the price. Alternatively, pick some Fintech stocks sensitive to rising rates (because higher rates are bullish loan providers). Just don't keep holding for ever, because there are better opportunities. 

These are some WSB trending tickers tonight. Notice some similarities?

3765,wallstreetbets,Infinite money glitch from gaming companies based on pre-orders,"We all know that gaming companies in 2020 rely heavily on pre-orders (PO) and hypes to get that extra revenue early.

**Here's the plan:** right after a big AAA title is announced, we buy calls (preferably on margin). Then each of us will buy 100 copies of the game. 1 million tards x 100 copies x 60$ = $6B expected revenue in a single day. This will make our calls print infinite. Then near the release date or whatever income report date, we all buy puts and everyone cancels their PO. This means the company will lose $6B in a single day, making our puts print infinite. We can use whatever trendy topic at the time (sexual harassment, poor employee treatments, human rights issues in China, etc) as the reason for canceling our PO.

3797,wallstreetbets,Zinc shortage is going unnoticed by majority of investors,"https://imgur.com/a/OzOeG00

TLDR: zinc go moon, buy zinc mining stocks/calls 

“All in all, a tight concentrate market and rising disruptions in the refined end amid low inventories are the major fundamental drivers behind the strong zinc market. Prices could stay elevated at least before the current power crisis dissipates,” said Wenyu Yao, Senior Commodities Strategist at Dutch multinational banking and financial services firm ING’s

Zinc’s biggest use is to galvanize steel or other metal products to prevent them from rusting. Demand has been increasing from literally every industry currently booming.

Supply is the main issue causing the current price run up. This isn’t an uncommon metal and within a year more zinc mines will come online motivated by record high spot prices and will bring balance to the force, I mean market.

In 2022 we can except $2/pound zinc very near term, most zinc producers have operating costs in the $0.60-$1 range and are currently undervalued based on the market not believing these high zinc prices will hold, let alone continue its uptrend.

The giant catalyst that spiked zinc to $1.84 is Nyrstar, a large mining/refining company closed down 3 of its smelters in Europe due to energy prices skyrocketing so high that the refined zinc ingots they produce are no longer profitable. The energy crisis in Europe is nowhere close to ending. There is talks of yet another smelter closing in France for the same reasons https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idCNL1N2T208E

China has state strategic reserves estimated between 250k-400k tons beginning of 2021. From July-October China sold 180k tons from its reserve in an attempt to cool off spot price. During this period Zinc still rose 20%.

And now we have chaos in Kazakhstan, entire internet and banking system shut down. Russian troops involved to calm the fatal protests. It’s all over the news about the Uranium supply disruption and 1.6 million bpd oil disruption. Not one single thing about Kazakhstan being a large Zinc producer and exporting 600 million pounds in 2020, 5% of yearly consumption. This could be the tipping point that shocks the industry and sends us to record high Zinc prices and it seems mostly unknown so far. Most Kazakhstan mines are run by western companies like Glencore and are unable to contact their operations to even find out the status of what’s going on. Eventually they will have to update their investors admitting they have no contact and that could be a huge catalyst.

Most purely Zinc mining companies that will provide the best leverage to rising spot prices are under $1 billion market cap and can’t be mentioned.",1641770337

3802,wallstreetbets,"Put/Call Plays next week: QQQ, AMD, GME, Peni Stonks","QQQ - Went in on SQQQ (inverse qqq) calls end of day friday. SQQQ is cheaper and you can buy more, out further while % profits are similar. the tnx ticker tracks 10 yr yields which a lot investors use as an inflation tracker and it has made a pretty fucking scary cup and handle that's breaking out. held these overnight because there's a strong likelihood of a heavy premarket drop.

* Calls on SQQQ or puts on QQQ ITM 
* Currently sitting at resistance/support but also under 100ma
* gap to fill by the 200ma and strong support under it but i think tech's bull run is over.
* Holding the majority of my SQQQ calls till it hits the 200ma then will reposition after a bounce/rest period. 371ish is a good spot to take some profits and i will. 

GME - Beautiful bearish pennant that's broke, retested and hammered down again to the 140 support. Under pretty much all moving averages on daily and 1hr. the FTD/NFT pop showed a really weak hand for the GME pump imo. 

* Under 140, ITM puts with a watch on 130 and 120 support areas (areas not specific. Mapping with boxes is better to keep that mindset.) Take profits in these areas and re-enter if drop continues 
* Looking for a quick drop/pop at open. Trade the bounce off of that not the initial drop. Gaps love to fill. Keep eyes on the Fiblvls and 9ma. I love using pivot point indicator as well. 
* Under 120 and the next stop is 115ish. Break of 115... i'll likely overnight puts bought end of day. Interested to see when the AH/PM drop happens.  
* Just an observation: Hopium GME'rs have noted calls from last year expire soon. MM loves to make those as worthless as possible. incentive from MM would be to heavy drive this down before jan 22. 

AMD - on watch. no play yet. Jan 11th is a decision deadline from China on the merger. I have very little faith in China playing in favor of anyone. I might take a yolo over night put:call 4:1 out of the money play. make money on it one way or the other. That decision will drive it 20$ north or south quickly.  

* Bearish 3 bar set up as of now. Solid support at 132ish. Under most of the moving averages
* There is a ridiculous amount of ITM Puts vs Calls on AMD for Jan 22 exp. Big money might know something that we dont (hence 4:1 play) 
* China Nice: pop AH/PM with light resistance around 143 and heavy resistance around 150. breaking out of the down trend started in december is unlikely given the current downward tech pressure. Will look at Puts around that 143/150 area if it turns
* China Mean: Drop AH/PM with light support around 119ish. Strong support around 100$. Will look at daily play from 119 down. 

PENI STONKS - I was born and raised on peni bios. Its a brutal learning experience for sure lol. Bearish is a must in them, but there is a lot of very promising smol cap plays that are due for a survival pump. And the recent OI jump for Jan 22 exp ITM calls in the ones that i've watched/traded through 2021. its  looking like its time for that.

* OI spiked 10x normal OI in the past week or so
* Cant post peni on WSB. will set up a post elsewhere if peaks your interest.  
* High risk. Manipulated af. 
* Many of these have Great Fundamentals and are trading with a market cap well below revenues. 
* Look for Jan exp OI thats way higher than normal. with charts that make you want to vomit and everyone on stocktwits losing their minds. 
* take profits take profits take profits. 30% at a time.

So if I buy a new car, get full insurance on it from day 1, and crash it, the insurance company will get me a brand new car with equal value from the manufacturer.

But here is the catch, I know they cant keep doing this forever, so if I keep crashing faster than they can make their cars, eventually they will face a severe choke in production, causing their share price to drop. I will already have puts and short positions opened.

Now you may think ""but hey, you will pay more on your insurance premiums every time you crash!""

True, I will pay more for my premiums, but the insurance will eventually run out of money, default, and have their share price drop, all the while I have puts and short positions open.

3870,wallstreetbets,Can we activate a short squeeze in the airline industry by all buying the tickets for the same flight?,"Sup retards. Here’s a foolproof plan to make us some fucking money in 2022.

Step 1: Short as much American Airlines as your broker will let you, then take the cash and buy tickets for a flight. 

(Further DD into this is needed, so one of you fuckers needs to find a suitable destination. As a reminder, we should chose a flight that will have a bunch of rich assholes that need to get to where they are going, and won’t take a buyout really under any circumstance.) 

Step 2: Diamond hand the FUCK out of those tickets, refuse to leave when asked. 

The key would be to buckle yourself into a seat (if you are lucky enough to get on) and then scream bloody murder if they try to remove you by force. I personally recommend kicking like your are fighting your older broker. Put ur feet up and let ‘em fly. 

Step 3: (The real money maker)

Use the ticket (which by now has probably increased in value ~300%) as collateral for a high interest, next day loan, and buy the tickets off the poor people next to you as to reduce the overall supply of tickets the airline can buy back without a fight. 

Then, use the tickets you buy from the suckers willing to sell to YOU, and use that as collateral to boost your broker margins and short the airline further. 

You may rinse and repeat these steps as much as you want, depending how many seats you can defend from the Air Marshals/what you monetary risk tolerance is. 

Will this action place us on a no fly list? Probably. But at that point we will be too rich to care.

None of the You Tube content by the Reddit pundits makes any sense. I think these punters are all just under water on their 2021 long positions; so they are inventing a squeeze headline hoping to move the stock up.

The main SEC report showed that buying to cover was a small proportion of the total volume. The whole rally was just just a self fulfilling prophesy. Therefore, all the pundits are anchoring on it; making up some conspiracy theory of a gamma squeeze, the T+35 theory and dwelling on the FTD’s. 

It might have another pop, but it won’t be due to gamma, or the MOASS’s; it’ll just be a momentum move because the Redditer’s find the balls to lift the ask again.

Explain To me why 25% of the short positions Have been covered but only .25% of the utilized shares have been returned. Something tells me that the “reported” shares on loan Is only 1% of the actual shorted shares, and there are actually 99% more shorts (naked) out there that have to cover in a squeeze. You do know how many synthetic or shares that is right? Thats 876 Million. I’m not saying I know, but I am saying that there are billions of ftds out there in this world due to the market makers that fail to deliver and damn near all of those ftds are intended to bring the stock price down by dilution. 

Imagine this, you take out a loan, and the bank just prints cash out at in the back to give you your money. That’s essentially what’s going on to bring stock prices down. It’s been happening for years, and it needs to end. This is the problem with our world, it’s effectively destroyed so many aspects of our lives. Think about how many people are not making enough money to live life right now. This feeling of despair that everyone is feeling is partially what has caused so many riots, division, depression, and mistrust towards the government. No one has control over what they do, but what we do have control over is what we do. We can buy, hold, and stop caring about money. That’s what it is, money controlling our lives. 


Citadel, and others, controlling the market. 
Think about this, if they aren’t delivering shares, where are they coming from? Well, they are “printing” them. They have effectively figured out a “legal” way to print money of the books. They are using the people to manipulate the people. They are pinning us against each-other. 

What can I say, I care about the people. Ken, and his friends? They don’t. 

One more thing, the end is near. Ken has stooped so low as to hire someone to take out the wife of the recent whistleblower on the subject of naked shorting. This was a big mistake, and when it is uncovered, the truth of all of this will be so unforgivable. Ken and you’re friends, I hope you see this and know how much you are unloved by society, and know how few people are on your side. This is the people against the few, and how many people are you willing to take down to control this narrative? It could be millions. Any correlation between your funding of Chinese companies and the beginning of the pandemic? 😉",1641757546
3903,wallstreetbets,Is it different this time? A wider perspective.,"While most of us believe stock market is extremely overvalued with many mini bubbles popping up everywhere, I just wanted to look at this a bit differently by introducing a historical perspective in terms of the companies that make up today's markets, technology, the wealth creation and generation and most importantly the flow of money into goods and services.

I wasn't old enough to grasp the dot-com crash back in early 2000's and while I do remember '08 crash pretty well, it took me many years to understand the underlying drivers of it. Over the years I tried to expand my knowledge of the markets and always tried to look at things from an historical perspective especially at those periods when markets were down/flat/didn't go anywhere for years or decades. With that perspective, what I want to try here is to use the benefit of hindsight, but not to state the obvious, but rather, state how things turned out in reality vs expectations at the time.

Listening to Warren Buffett's older speeches, one of the things he mentions often was that how American society thought they would be taken over by Japan in terms of technological advancement back in the late 70's and early 80's and that there was not enough optimism with respect to American innovation that could prevail its leadership going into the following decades. While obviously not the only factor, this lack of optimism was apparently evident in markets and there were many years not much was happening.

It is actually fascinating to observe that over the coming years, the exact opposite has happened. Introduction of computer in the 60's in the west coast, perhaps much earlier than most of the world, the creation of Silicon Valley and emergence in big-tech are more than just happenstance. I am not an American. While i will not go too further deep into this topic here, my personal view is this all goes back to foundations of the country and the fact that there is no cultural baggage/deeply embedded subconscious that prevents things from happening on this side world. Perhaps the big reason for this is the change in behavior/consciousness of people who emigrated here and were able to drop the burdens of the past.

If you think about the wealth currently possessed in our world, most of it was perhaps created/generated in the last 50-100 years (perhaps even 20-30 years). You might have been born somewhere with rich history (as I was), your forefathers and the empires that they have built could have ruled the world for hundreds or thousands of years and conquered every corner of the world, but none of that matters now. It's as if millions of years of history is almost irrelevant at this point because you were either able to adapt things in the past few decades or you were not. What I am obviously talking about here is the new creation of wealth as the existing wealth matters less and less each day. One of the reasons for this is obviously the fact that the world has not seen a ""reset"" since World War 2. It is perhaps the first time in history when we had such prolonged peace.

Let's thing for a second the implications of globalization in this peace period. This is perhaps the first time in history where the world is so connected that even the products we use on a daily basis are the same. Imagine the flow of goods and services 50 years ago or even 25 years ago. Were you able to access goods and services overseas this easily? Where would your disposable income be spent on? Even 25 years ago local markets did matter for the most part. I'd watch local TV, buy local newspaper, only a handful people had cellphones, internet was still nascent, most of the appliances in your home were already a commodity. If you had disposable income, most of the money would be circulated within the local economy and the most expensive things would be the house you'd buy (that obviously does not change today) and a car which would benefit a few countries but not a single country (perhaps Germany for the most part). So all in all, there was no single country that the money was flowing into. This is was not possible by design.

I am not saying all this goes away now. But thinking for a second, isn't this really the first time that a significant portion of disposable income, wherever you are in the world, flows into one single country? And for economies in which this does not happen, do they really matter to the global wealth in grand scheme of things?

Europe or Middle East for instance, amazing blend of many cultures, languages. The entire world once was ruled from Mesopotamia, then Ancient Egypt/Ancient Greece, then Rome and so on. Are they relevant anymore? What does a beloved country of Italy contribute to world economy these days? France? Spain? UK? South East Asia? - amazing corners of the world, billions of amazing people. Do they matter from a wealth creation and money of flow perspective? Of course they do, but to what extent if you think about 'end products' - goods and services. What they do produce that the entire world consumes/needs. Of course Middle East has oil. But oil is a raw material and the goods and services used by this wealth creation does not necessarily change - the cars they buy, the planes they fly, the services they use are not locally produced. Take Saudi Arabia, a total GDP about $800 billion with all the oil. Apple generated $366 billion revenues in the last twelve months (obviously not the best analogy).

Let's expand upon this.

Let's assume you wake up in the corner of the world and don't have survival problem. What you do or spend your time is not significantly different than us here in the US. Your homepage is google for everything, you use whatsapp to talk to your friends, you are on instagram, your business uses outlook/microsoft, your phone is samsung/apple/android, you log into youtube on a daily basis, you prefer to watch netflix over local TV. (Sure, China is different from this aspect but it is also the reason why they have been outpacing everywhere else in terms of economic growth. They were not stupid about this and realized the effects of globalization early on).

Now, you might be thinking - dude that is only such a small portion of the world. Millions of people don't even have access to any of those. I am well aware of that and while it is correct for the most part, from an ""overall wealth creation perspective"", billions of people actually don't matter all. It may sound so harsh, but think about the many countries of the world with millions of population and realize that their total GDP is less than the cash sitting idle on Berkshire Hathaway balance sheet.

Or think of this perspective: What would happen if their disposable income was magically 10x tomorrow? What goods and services would they spend their money on? Is it really the local goods and services that would benefit from the overall increase in GDP - of course to a great extent - but is it really a handful of companies in the world that would actually benefit disproportionately from this wealth increase when that happens? If everybody in India could afford iPhones would they buy something else instead? Or would they be able to produce a competing good or a service locally that the entire world would consume? Would the money really flow elsewhere?

Or are they really late in the game anyway, as we already argued that in the wealth creation game only the most recent period matters.

Since the dot-com bubble era, I'd argue that a lot of things have changed. It is interesting because dot-com bubble was the classic innovation pattern - people knew internet was the next big thing but it was not exactly clear who the winners in the next decades would be. 20 years since, we know who the winners are. We know what business models work, what business models can scale, have network effects and become profitable and so on. Horses vs cars was another classical example. You did not have to be a genius to realize cars would take over horses but time was harsh to many car companies in that there was no one single winner. It was by design of the product it became commoditized. Same can be argued for air travel. Internet however is different. While new business models emerge, consolidation and monopolistic effects are far more real - it's a world big becomes bigger as it employs smartest people, outbids competition, and constantly innovates.

Of course there is no guarantee this will go on like this. After all, if you look at top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 for each of the past several decades, you will see interesting results. How will the next big thing overthrow the existing giants when big always get bigger, especially when they benefit from the overall wealth increase in every corner of the world? Perhaps it will be a new technology or maybe a catastrophe that can trigger this. While I'd never want to guess the future, I am inclined to think as long as the status-quo peace continues, certain companies in the world - as they keep their innovative pace - will continue to dominate.

Is the market expensive? It sure is. But what will happen tomorrow if GOOG, AAPL, AMZN drop by 20% tomorrow? Wouldn't people rush to put their entire wealth the next day? Sure multiples can contract. But is a 25bps/50bps move in rates going to destroy these companies? Would it make them worth less? Yes discounted cash flows should be lower and they may be growing 15% instead of 20%. But 5 years from now, are we going to see something similar to dot-com bubble where things don't recover?

But where else can the money go when your disposable income will be spent on that next iPhone, or half your time is spent on instagram/whatsapp/youtube/google, your businesses use Microsoft and its products and that does not going to change ""that easily"". These are important as indices are market-cap weighted indices. So we need a correction in big-tech more than anything else.

None of this is against the argument that the markets will not correct. However, I do not think the examples of dot-com era or 08' are not justified. I think something ""bigger"" than 25bps increase in rates is needed for US markets to crash and stay at those levels for longer periods of time. And I did not even go into the demographic changes here which is a totally different animal on its own.

&amp;#x200B;

TA request from u/BuffaloRhode RSI telling us it should shit the bed soon. Looked at the 10P 1/21 and noticed Friday there was an 801 volume and an open interest of 15,432. This high open interest seems abnormal on a relatively short expiration date.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reasoning**

My reasoning of only 40% is SPY calls have a better return on investment/better bid and ask spread. Expect UVXY to drop this week with bank earnings/dems likely using reconciliation on Build Back Better. Banks should blow earnings because there is no stimmy yet and R2D2 is worse than ever.

Pelosi stated, ""In order to do it this weeee \*stutters and corrects herself\* In order to pass Build Back Better it's under reconciliation we only need 51 votes."" In my opinion, she corrected herself because she didn't want to leak any information. **NEVER BET AGAINST DEMS,** SPY YTD would look like BABA.

3929,wallstreetbets,"""The best investment is to invest in yourself"" is a hoax","On investing subreddits and the sigma grindset instagram pages, I will often see the following phrase: ""The best investment is to invest in yourself"". While it sounds great, I am here to say that this advice is a complete hoax and completely contradictory to sound investing. 

First and foremost, you should only invest in things you believe in. This will allow you to be passionate about your investment and weather through the downturns when there is one. The problem is - I don't have a shred of belief in myself. Ergo, I should not be investing in myself. 

Second, you should only believe in things you know very well. As a lost Gen Z er, I don't know myself at all. I'm not quite sure what my ambitions are and I have no idea if I will ever find out. Ergo, investing in myself would be foolish. 

Third, you should only invest in things you have conviction in. I have very little conviction in my future. In fact, given my track record, I will end up in a Wendy's dumpster before I even know it. In stock terms, my conviction is at an all time low. So investing in myself makes absolutely no sense. 

Fourth, you should only invest in things you will hold long term. The problem is - I never had a dad growing up and I didn't exactly have an affectionate mother. No one exactly held me when I was young, and therefore I do not want to hold myself long term either. Investing in myself doesn't sound so great. 

With that, I rest my case. Invest in yourself is a complete hoax.",1641753237

Then he was in Consumer Product (I.E. merchandising) and then the parks in a tenure symbolized by hiking the prices while being cheap on the experience. (the NBA Experience replacing Disney Quest shows it)

Now as a CEO he has been very ""controversial"". What happened to the parks have only worsen now. And the pushing films to Disney+ have not been meat good by people inside the company like Marvel and Pixar. And there are overall ""bad taste"" decision made under the start of his tenure while can't be blamed on him from what we know like the cancelation of The Owl House and giving Quantum Dream a Star Wars game. So overall its feel like the Disney empire is sinking under his term.

I was looking for support sites since financially it is impossible for us to cover the expenses and I was able to find this page and I would like you to help me with what you can since my father is the only thing I have left in my life, since my mother had to do two years due to ovarian cancer.

The doctors in charge of seeing my dad's progress gave me the budget amount to carry out his recovery, which would be between USD $ 1500 to $ 3500 depending on his progress.

All proceeds will be fully reaffirmed for the expenses that are needed for him health.

4007,wallstreetbets,This is how to make money in the stock market 😂,,1641742737
4008,wallstreetbets,My view on $WISH,"First of all it's not a financial advice so please do your own DD before investing on anything and only invest the amount you are fully prepared to loose!

I am long WISH and I might be little biased; however I am in it to make money so I heartily welcome all LONG BEAR points; not short. Short terms are mostly driven by events and not business fundamentals so WISH could go to $2 if people do not like the new CEO for example ! There is no limit how much low a stock can go unfortunately; please go read Peter Lynch. If you are trying to time the market, good luck!! Also if you are a day trader, good luck to you as well !! - I recently read a post from fellow investor who turned over over $28 million in a year and was in negative $7600 :) I personally think it's not worth the time and emotional well being.

What I have learned during my 5 years investing journey is that stocks mostly move (up and down) driven by sentiment; it comes down to demand and supply - if people are willing to sell for less OR if there are less buyers than sellers, price moves down. These are mostly driven by \`catalysts\` - a positive/negative earnings, black/white swan events, macro events or even a PR ! But these move do not usually last long so unless you are trying to time the market, its very difficult to win most of the time.

I would mostly like to focus on two things on this DD - why WISH is down? and if it can recover. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why WISH is down so much?**

**Sector rotation:**

1. The short answer is sector rotation - BIG money going elsewhere. It's just not WISH, whe whole growth small cap sector is down big time. And there are some add-ons to it - SPAC/new IPOs are further down, e-commerce sector is further down, growth are hammered, companies having China ties are further down. Just look at 1 year charts of these companies for example - STNE (Warren buffet is an investor), BABA (Charlie Munger), CLOV/OPEN (Chamath); TDOC, CRSP (Cathie Wood) even PayPal and SQ are down big time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Macro events:**

* Chinese govt crackdown on tech companies- BABA, DIDI, BAIDU and whole Chinese tech. This negatively effected WISH as well.
* Reopening of economy drove consumers to stores and it made the 2nd quarter look bad.
* Apple changed privacy policy and it had huge impact on Ad spending (it impacted many growth companies who relied on Ad spending to procure customers) - price went up 2-3 times
* Supply chain issues - specifically goods coming out of China.
* Inflation and rising interest fear in the market

&amp;#x200B;

**Other WISH specific catalysts:**

* CEO's departure
* BIG investors exit
* Slow down (pause) of growth and MAU down
* CEO's leaving
* Down trend causing price to go further down - sentiment, margin call, tax harvesting and few others.

&amp;#x200B;

**And finally some noise:**

* Negative short articles all over (by shorts)
* Lawsuits (mostly fake)
* High short selling (by short term traders)
* Insiders selling (no real selling - almost all of them are for tax purpose to cover RSU)

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, can WISH recover?** 

Absolutely ! Go look at NIO, ETSY, TSLA, AMD and even AMZN - you can find many. It may take some time since there are ton of attractive companies to invest in right now - let's just take BABA for example; I believe it should be trading at 3x today. But I am staying put at WISH because I believe BABA can't 10x and WISH has that potential. Here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

* Has been built over a period of decade and over $2 billion has been invested in the business (including advertisings) before IPO money. Go look at CrunchBase - there were many rounds of investing and many investors invested over $5b valuation level before 2015. As everybody knows WISH was offered by AMZN and BABA $10 billion in 2015. 
* Came from IPO and not SPAC route. When companies go for IPO, due diligence/valuation is little strict compared to SPAC deals as the Banks have to underwrite. It was valued at $24 a share. At the time JPMC and few others have $30.
* Is a global e-commerce platform and not US only like ETSY, Wayfair, Overstock etc.. It's not cheap to build a global e-commerce platform so there is a significant barrier of entry.
* Has its own business segment that no US/Western company has - serving low to middle class value seeking customer base. Since it is global, it has huge potential to penetrate into India, Brazil and African markets as well. Look at Flipcart (India), MercadoLibre (brazil), Jumia (africa) - WISH do not need to win anywhere, just a small slice of cake is more than enough to increase revenue significantly!
* Has now built its own logistics business - $1 billion revenue is not a joke! Imagine small merchants being able to ship worldwide effortlessly! Most of the third world countries have copyright issues/fake product issues - they are willing to spend higher if they can buy authentic Nike shoes for example.
* Has $1.2 billion in cash. Over the period of last 6 months I have investigated many companies and I haven't seen any companies in WISH's size to have that much money with no debt. Inflation is rising interest rates are no problem for WISH. I've read people's concern about cash burn, but that's going to be stabilized starting this quarter. $1 billion is a lot of money to spend for growth! It can even buy small companies to diversify its business, invest in new technology and even buy it's own share (its highly unlikely for growth companies though). WISH actually has already working on WISH clips, live shopping and new influencer led business. I believe 1Sansome has potential to be a billion dollar business in no time ! Go look at SHEIN -I encourage people to compare SHEIN and 1Sansome website. SHEIN is now a $10 billion dollar business, mind you.
* Is promptly acting to align/fix it's business - revamping it's website, introducing video clips/live shopping, fixing merchant/product quality issues, improving shipping time and potentially getting into new business segments - fintech, payment processing, trend shopping etc.
* Got the best management in place now. Forget Peter - he was an engineer and not a business person. Google was actually run by Eric Schdmit and was brought by the founders Surgery and Larry. I recognize the charm about founder led companies but he still does own about 20% of the business so he is vested. In fact, he is the one who brought Jackie. Peter has become millionaire from billionaire so he has the most vested interest in WISH than any of us! and I encourage people to go read Jackie's employment terms - her major compensation starts when the WISH stock reaches $30! Also most of the higher management is paid in RSU so its in their interest to make the company successful and remain with WISH.
* Has the most cost efficient business model - It doesn't need investment in physical warehouse. It's employee efficiency is highest in the industry - just about 1000 people running the company VS SHEIN with 10,000 employees !
* Rising Ad costs are effecting every e-commerce growth companies but WISH's Ad campaign is the most efficient of most of them. In fact Facebook offered $20 million for its Ad algorithm very early on. I've read many posts that WISH Ad campaign is one of the most efficient campaign in Facebook so it would fare better and can remain competitive.
* Even though WISH's revenue is decreased and MAU's have decreased, it's still very significant - go compare with ETSY. This quarter is important - if it can become close to cash flow positive with less AD spending and still manages to maintain 40M active users and about 1.5B revenue, it's already a lot ! I do not see any issues doubling the revenue if WISH can make those customers happy and increase their LTV.
* Major competitor is Aliexpress but go try buying something from there and try to return an item or settle an issue! You have to deal with the seller first. WISH no question asked - you even keep your item. Also WISH's growing its merchant base all the world - about 50% are now US based.
* E-commerce segment is growing fast and would pass $8 by 2025. With fast delivery and last mile delivery solved, traditional competitors like dollar general, five below and even Macy's JCPenny and most will be wiped out or wouldn't be able to compete. WISH should benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Common perceptions:**

* Selling Chinese products =&gt; It's not even a point - more than 90% products sold all over the world are from China and it's for a reason - its most cheaper to manufacture products there. Most items Amazon sells are made in China. But the point is WISH is trying to create/promote Chinese brands - Assume a Chinese shoes brand that compares with Nike but half the cost.
* Selling dildos - Sex toys are billions of dollar business. I don't see negatives there.
* Selling cheap products - it's the main business ! Dollar General has $50 billion market cap alone and there are others - dollar tree, five below and even Japanese Daiso
* Float too high for short squeeze : Look at Nokia; it went up 80% in one day last year - it has 10 times the float of WISH.
* Cash burn - I would like to point out that companies are not usually upfront about investments. For example google categories them under \`New bets\`. So investment in 1Sansome for example might be hidden under SG&amp;A ! We do not know what else is out there investment/initiative wise.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are few upcoming catalysts:**

* New CEO: Whoever is brought in, his fortune will be tied to WISH. Also whoever it is, it would be far better than Peter business wise.
* Fourth Qtr earnings: Cash burn should stabilize and it should be close to EBTDA positive, if not a surprise profit !
* Website revamp: Hopefully it will fix many issues including having to login ! I also think just a minor fix such as sorting a search results by price, reviews, sales and other metric should drive sales. Right now, I can't sort by specific products that are highest sellers in the category ! Its so dumb :) 
* Wish standard, Wish access, revamped website, quality control, Wish clip and efficient use of marketing dollar should help return to growth.
* Also very excited about 1Sansome - I believe its a underdog.
* Investors who sold for a loss might be returning soon. For example I can't imagine why Jack Morris wouldn't buy back WISH at $3 unless he was not true about investment before.
* I have a feeling we will see Institutional investment reaching back above 80% when the SEC filings come out this quarter. Vanguard now is the 2nd highest investor and its average is about $8.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also like to share my observation that you have to have a high conviction in companies you invest in otherwise you would sell if it 2x tomorrow for example. Many TSLA investors made millions because they stayed put and are still invested even after 15x. Elon Musk used to say he was cash poor until a year ago ! It applies to many companies - in facts most billionaires have concentrated portfolio : Bezoz - AMZN, Musk - TSLA, Bill Gates - Microsoft etc.

Another important saying by Buffet - If your stomach hurts too much when you are down 50% or over, you should not be investing in Equity ! I plan to stay invested at least 2 years or WISH passes $30 a share. Please convince me why I should sell WISH - Like I said I am here to make money and open to find other better opportunities.

I’m not insanely rich, I make average wage and can put around $300-$500 a month into stocks, which I’m okay with losing if it goes the wrong way (asking here to avoid that).

From what I’ve looked at, the stocks that seem interesting to me in order would be

RBLX (metaverse stock due to play to earn)

AAPL (car design for 2025 and leading phone)

4095,wallstreetbets,A20 Biomes (Ranked/Discussed,"Since absolutely nobody asked, I'm going to share my opinion on the Biomes in A20 (RIP Burnt Forest). All of my experience in A20 has been on the 10K Pregen, so this is not tailored to Navezlame plebs. 

**First of all, here are the Biomes ranked by lootstage:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Wasteland
2. Winter
3. Desert
4. Forest

**Now, the Biomes ranked by my opinion of difficulty:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Wasteland (Landmines, demon doggo's, and relentless waves of zombies)
2. Desert (Threat of heat, FUCKING VULTURES, and asshole mini cacti)
3. Winter (Threat of cold, chad lumberjacks, and high amount of aggressive animals)
4. Forest (Dark as hell, but no unique zombies, and no threat from weather)

**And finally, my personal overall ranking of Biomes, with 3 unique traits of each:**  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Winter  (Highest visibility at night, TONS of meat/water, best lootstage/livability ratio)  
2. Forest (Lowest visibility at night, lowest lootstage, but you can run around naked)
3. Wasteland (Highest lootstage/difficulty, largest cities, every other biome is just the tutorial) 
4. Desert (Aloe/Fuel, easiest buried treasures, character is as sweaty as people that nerdpole)   

In conclusion, I find the Winter Biome to be the most livable when you are ready to move on from your trader in the Forest Biome. I move as soon as I have a Forge, Workbench, cold weather gear, and the Bicycle from completing 7 quests. Situation yourself near the Wasteland Biome from within the Snow Biome is, in my opinion, as ideal as it gets. Let me know what you think!",1641725437

4114,wallstreetbets,A look into how Tesla is becoming the European market leader,"Thankyou for reading my long and lengthy post, this is from my free newsletter the Tesla folder.

I keep hearing the words, “the competition is coming, the competition is coming.” So can you then help me understand what is going on in Europe? Tesla's lead continues to grow whilst everyone is sitting at home saying that Tesla will not succeed in Europe? I mean you name a country and the chances are Tesla is the best selling B.E.V in that country.

**Tesla’s lead in Western Europe**

In Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom Tesla has become the best selling vehicle brand. Now you might say, ‘well yes but there are barely any electric vehicles sold compared to ICE vehicles.’ You would be wrong, the Global share of B.E.V’s is rapidly expanding,

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1m6olomlvma81.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e65f87adf05568a20f0d0924213107dc6ce613d

In Europe they now account for roughly 20% of the total car sold. Whilst in places like Norway the new care sales are nearly 90% entirely electric vehicles

So, what the f\*\*k is going on in Europe? Let me explain.

Thanks for reading Tesla Folder! The rest of this article is free, but please support my work by subscribing for free to receive new posts and support my work.

**Why Tesla is leading in the UK, Norway and Switzerland**

The turning point was in the third quarter where Tesla’s deliveries rose to 45,000 units higher than its previous record number of deliveries. Tesla was now shipping thousands of vehicles from their Shanghai factory to Europe. As a result Tesla had grown their BEV market share to 15% thanks to the third quarter 2021 push. In the 3 fully completed quarters so far Tesla has been forcing its way into the European market, as you can see here (below) in Germany. Its competitors are either stagnating or declining whilst Tesla is capturing more of the entire automotive market as the world transitions to electric vehicles.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/61m9raamvma81.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf2e64fec82df16833917e911a99ac6b6b1efbc0

Tesla is now set to surpass Volvo’s market share early in 2022 as they only trail volvo by 2,000 units registered in Q3 as in September alone Tesla delivered twice as many vehicles as Volvo did across Western Europe. Tesla delivered 33,900 whilst Volvo only managed 16,793 vehicles. Tesla is slowly on an exponential curve growing their deliveries as there are now nearly 500,000 Tesla’s roaming around Europe.

If we look at Norway, we can see truly the growth that Tesla is about to experience is going to be unprecedented. Tesla has become the best selling vehicle of any sort in Norway for 2021, The model 3 came in at first and the model Y came in at fourth place. Whilst incredibly 80% of the top 10 selling vehicles where all electric cars. In 2021 64.5% of all vehicles purchased where electric in Norway, leading the world but as you can see this growth is exponential and the world will follow soon. I Norway electric car sales have nearly doubled in two years.

**EV registrations per year in Norway**

Ok but that is just one example you say? Well lets look at Switzerland. Oh yeah, the Model #3 was only the number one selling vehicle in 2021. Note that this includes Ice VEHICLES!

And as a final example, this graph for the United Kingdom should be self explanatory.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gb7lxk0qvma81.jpg?width=451&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1121f94d16a6b599ce1b95dafbb167b22df67c48

Now that you have a better understanding of simply how dominant Tesla has been in these countries, lets zoom out and take a look at Europe and what is about to happen..

**Tesla in Europe and Giga Factory Berlin**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gwm2s59ovma81.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37768c00411f5da21fe9f7ddf6ec374b4a32080

Now that we have looked at the current situation, let's take something else into account, every Tesla sold in Europe has been either imported from China or the United States.

In Q1 2022 Tesla is expected to open Giga Berlin, which is going to have an end capacity of more than 1 million vehicles. Which for context would be about ⅓ of the total number of cars sold in Germany per year. When Giga Berlin comes online this year and starts producing around 100-150,000 vehicles Tesla will see huge growth in its market share. Similarly, European made Tesla’s will see a much higher profit margin due to the fact that they no longer have to be imported and because Giga Berlin will be a state of the art facility.

Due to the lower import costs Tesla’s can also become cheaper, although I doubt Tesla will lower prices greatly due to the insane demand they are facing. But the capacity of Berlin is not to be doubted.

Elon Musk has previously said that “ I think, hopefully, Giga Berlin — this factory here — can serve as inspiration to people in Germany and throughout for excitement about the future. I mean, we gotta be excited about the future.”

The expectation is that Giga Berlin will produce around 100-250k vehicles in 2022, ramping up to 1 million at peak capacity.

Just look (see below) at how fast **Giga Shanghai** has grown its production, we can expect Tesla to have learnt much from Shanghai and will implement these changes to Berlin to help scale production at a similar rate here in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot explain how excited I am for Giga Berlin to open up in January. I think it's going to be a huge turning point for the conversation surrounding Tesla and its dominance in Europe.

They already have a rachet client base who destroy the entire place often and I'm sure the staff are quitting in droves. This shit deserves to be at asset book value until top golf or something with some class can absorb it. 

If we all go to Dave and busters and order cheap beer and abuse the unlimited wings deal they do once a month while not contributing a cent to the games then we can successfully run a short campaign that will provide tendies. 

I know it sounds dark and you may say ""where will I buy tendies when their bankrupt."" So that introduces the pair trade Domino's.

Go long domino's shares and short the fuck out of D&amp;B. Start a movement at r/antiwork to shill against Dave and busters to accelerate tendies.

It's so free. Just wait for earnings which you know will be bad because you went there once a week and abused the unlimited wings while using way too many consumables. The more time you spend there the more confident you will become. Trust me.

TLDR: puts on Dave and Busters at all earnings calls after some of us decide to go there and be the least cost effective customers we can possibly be. (Make restaurant lose money on you + make staff want to quit)

Go long domino's for a pair trade so you can jack your margin to the tits.

4147,wallstreetbets,$BYND : Partnerships and Short Percentage.,"I mean, let's not forget BYND was once the apple of the average ancient ape's eye in WSB. The stock had an ATH of $230+ and was constantly above $100 holding stable for a good while. The recent partnerships are huge yet I'm skeptical of how it is going to be viewed by the majority. The company says they're aiming for the consumers' NY Resolutions to eat more plant-based food, that sounds good in marketing yet I don't really know how practical it is. I really would love to know how the vegans and vegetarians in the subreddit view the partnership and if they would try the plant-based options. I was on Instagram and Twitter earlier today and saw some pretty damaging sentiment; vegans and vegetarians were discussing how they wouldn't support it or consume it. 

That aside, hedgies are going retard mode into shorting BYND. The current short % of float sits at **39.04%**. Float is about 56.45M. I'm not an extremely technical guy but that tells me either the shorts are seeing something I'm not or they're going ape shit on a stock with a lot of upward pressure partnering with big names like KFC. They've also established partnerships with Panda Express and A&amp;W Canada.

Goal - 100k in my portfolio 

My Rules :
1. No trading until 30 mins after the market opens
2. No same day trades
3. Don't pick options further out of the money just because they are cheaper
4. No SPY 
5. 20% profit is better than no profit/loss
6. Do my own dd before buying

My plan is to take off work for the next week and make as many twitter accounts as I can. I would keep doing this until they run out of server space and can't hold any more accounts. I would then go around and let people know that when I tried making an account that I wasn't able to.

This in turn should cause a big issue and I'm assuming a decent amount of people would close their accounts leading for the stock price to fall.

4189,wallstreetbets,"Theranos fraud in the news, spotlight on genomics, $BNGO's 2022 Symposium begins Monday and will feature around 25 presentations from Bionano Genomics customers. Crucify me if I fail.","Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud for falsifying data and misleading investors in her blood testing machine, Edison.

People lost hundreds of millions of dollars investing in Theranos because she lied about having a working machine for blood testing without having any peer review analysis.

Here's the 60 minutes piece on it because I don't want to write out a bunch of bullet points: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIqF95qiQSs

All this is to say, Bionano Genomics has a PROVEN machine with tons of peer review that is, by all accounts, more cost effective and more accurate than other machines on the market.

The upcoming symposium (https://www.labroots.com/ms/virtual-event/bngo2022) will feature around 25 Bionano Genomics customers speaking on a range of topics.

From the website:

""Event Highlights:

At the Bionano Genomics 2022 Symposium, you will hear from over 25 customers around the world who will showcase their findings and answers using OGM. Each day will feature customer presentations, a live panel with Q&amp;A, as well as poster presentations by topic area.

Topics include:

Monday, January 10: Constitutional Cytogenomics

Tuesday, January 11: Hematologic Malignancies

Wednesday, January 12: Solid Tumors

Thursday, January 13: OGM + NGS

Even though each day is topic specific, we encourage you to attend all days and sessions that interest you. All presentations will be recorded and available on demand after the symposium concludes.""

This stock has been hammered, but fair value is sitting around $4.95 according to Macroaxis.

I know the market isn't favoring growth at the moment and there are lots of theories as to what 2022 will look like, but this company is the real deal. I don't know how long it will take, but I'm fairly confident Bionano Genomics will be at the forefront of the industry.

I know BNGO tends to trade sideways or go down with good news, but the January 10th symposium looks VERY promising, especially considering that Theranos (and the genomic space) is in the spotlight at the moment.

I've been holding since $0.54 after taking some profits, but I bought some call options on Thursday and will likely buy more on Monday morning at a couple different strike prices.

I Think HOOD is the most risky because it is a new company with no earnings but may have the most upside if in fact it can turn a profit and continue to add users. Second is BABA the only risk I see here is the fact that China is in talks of delisting besides that I Think This Stock Is Undervalued and has great upside potential If China Can Come Up W| A Solution. SQ Seems to be the least risky but I feel the upside is attached to how well they can integrate there platform with cryptocurrency, I think any company thats future is tied into c****o will likely be extremely volatile and hard to value correctly.

4271,wallstreetbets,"After seeing Sony's new announcement about diving into the EV industry, I'm starting to understand why Dr. Burry Is saying Tesla is a Bubble.","This isn't financial advice nor is it me saying buy up Sony stock. After seeing a bunch of EV companies such as Lucid motors, Rivian, NIO, and now apparently Sony wanting to dive into the EV space. I'm beginning to understand why Burry claimed Tesla is a bubble. Sony was the final nail in the coffin to convince me that there will be plenty of competition in the future for EV vehicles simply because Sony is a tech company. 

WTF  is a tech company doing trying to get into the car industry you may ask? Well my friends, we were asking the same question when Apple announced their plans to dive into this industry as well. The simplest answer is most likely because they can. Seeing as EV's consist of mostly electronics and a battery, what's stopping these companies from selling a ***fresh*** (over priced) product that is finally not a phone, television, or refrigerator. Seeing two tech companies making cars has me jacked, like really fucking jacked. Not only that, but there will also be competition with the more established auto companies that have been around for more if not close to a hundred years. Do not even get me started on the more luxury focused car companies.

The sooner you understand we are all natural born crayon eaters the sooner you are on the path to tendieland. Never trust anyone or yourself, at first. If something seems retarded to you at first, it's probably genius. Same thing if you see other people saying that. I don't care who they are. Do more research into it. Figure out how retarded everyone is so you can replace those crayon dinners with chicken feasts.

**2nd Law of Wendy's: Confusion.** The more confusing and convoluted the information is the likelier it is you'll make get big tendies. Big words and vocabulary you don't really understand means it's above your paygrade and therefore likely the opposite of retarded. Learn more about it and see if it's worth buying.

**3rd Law of Wendy's: Diamond Hands.** If you're betting around short term small movement you're going to paper hand or miss out. The best things can be volatile or daunting before doing the research. The payout has to be worth the risk otherwise you'll lose out over time even if you win more often. See that stock down 50%? It might the best or the worst opportunity of your life, you don't know that based on the chart alone. See that stock up 500% it might get rug pulled or keep going, you just don't know and need to look into it more before FOMO'ing in or bitching out.

**4th Law of Wendy's: Allocation size.** Go all in and eventually you'll be homeless. Good plays don't work out and bad ones do work out. Be ready to double, quadruple down, or even quit with some other money. Nothing you see is financial advice including this guide for retards.

**Postions Attached**

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the chart you will notice TSLA has been price consolidating (based on RSI) and is prone to breakout next week. There has been a ladder attack (based on random fat/buy-sell orders) since about 3 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**The reasoning for a breakout next week**

TSLA 1500C 1/21

Volume Friday = 1,685

Open Interest Friday = 18,182

&amp;#x200B;

TSLA 1400C 1/14

Volume Friday = 2,438

Open Interest Friday = 2,628

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Open Interest Friday 348

&amp;#x200B;

SPY 500C 1/14

Volume Friday = 2,040

Open Interest Friday = 1,955

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Looking at these deep OTM contracts I anticipate a hard tech rally next week. This ladder attack has been going on long enough and shorts probably want to stop paying fees if there is no dip on SPY below $450/TSLA below $899.
2. Tesla earnings are on 1/26, so I expect an earnings run-up breaking ATH and a continued rally, given their bullish delivery numbers the other week.
3. Shorts will also cover (creating a fat bull run for TSLA) since stocks go up, not flat for 3+ months.
4. Cramer ignores TSLA Friday in his article “**Jim Cramer says these 5 ‘old tech’ stocks could have a big year in 2022.”** Always inverse Cramer for Tech. Link:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/jim-cramer-says-these-5-old-tech-stocks-could-have-a-big-year-in-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/jim-cramer-says-these-5-old-tech-stocks-could-have-a-big-year-in-2022.html)
5. Cramer said on 1/6 don’t buy the tech dip and on Friday, Tech doesn’t dip another 2%+ Inverse Cramer. Link: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/cramer-says-its-too-early-to-buy-aggressively-after-rough-2022-start.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/cramer-says-its-too-early-to-buy-aggressively-after-rough-2022-start.html)
6. Elon sold before TSLA dipped to around $1,020 Friday. I expect Elon to rebuy this upcoming week given the earnings run-up and the deep OTM TSLA weekly 1/14 calls. Like who tf drops that much money in deep OTM TSLA weeklies?

7. Bullish AF anticipated Production/delivery numbers coming. It seems like TSLA will continue producing/delivering a boatload on cars. In Q4 they produced/delivered roughly 33% of the 2021 numbers Link: [https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries)

Bartender with $80,000 k to put somewhere.
I have no 401 k or invested in anything. 

I plan on buying a house and maybe starting a business in 5 years. 

Questions are 

1) should I go with a company like Charles Schwab or a smaller more personalized company?

2) is 401k my best option? 
I see ROTH IRA a lot- I don't know what that is 
EFTs like VOO, SWPPX (I don't know just what I see a lot of ) 

3) how do I save and invest at the same time? 

4) if there a place to put money that would get me more money than putting it somewhere else? 

5) what kind of average yearly yield would putting my money somewhere make me?

Once again- any input would be greatly appreciated.

""Four days ago, the Federal Reserve released the names of the banks that had received $4.5 trillion in cumulative loans in the last quarter of 2019 under its emergency repo loan operations for a liquidity crisis that has yet to be credibly explained. Among the largest borrowers were JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, three of the Wall Street banks that were at the center of the subprime and derivatives crisis in 2008 that brought down the U.S. economy. That’s blockbuster news. But as of 7 a.m. this morning, not one major business media outlet has reported the details of the Fed’s big reveal.""

In the late 90s, early 2000s, internet companies fucking exploded and became a huge bubble when it came to public eye. Also known as the dot com bubble

2017-2018 weed stocks fucking exploded when it became legalized. Also known as the weed bubble

2020 EV stocks fucking exploded when they got national attraction. Also known as the (not yet known yet, name will come in a few years)

All of these resulted in huge fucking gains, huge bubbles, in huge disruptive sectors


What’s next ?

SPACE SPACE SPACE, this is a trillion dollar market in the making, with Elon musk riding this juggernaut to the moon. SPACE has the exact characteristics of all previous bubbles, huge potential market, untapped market, and huge hype

Either when Elon musk takes space x public, or in years from now when space becomes more hot (and it will according to Elon musk and billionaires)RKLB WILL EXPLODE regardless of how good there doing as a sympathy(which imo there on top doing good)  just like all the weed companies mooned, all the tech companies mooned in 2000, and all the EVs in 2020

RKLB IS bassically on top besides SpaceX and will almost guaranteed moon from space bubble when it happens.

Also Peter beck is fucking bad ass, he ate his own hat, college dropout, stupid smart, bassically new Zelands Elon musk, who knows, he could create the space hype

4424,wallstreetbets,"Hi, just thought I’d throw this out there for 4X-8X money","AVCT is at a crucial point of interest. If it breaks up on Monday, it will likely push resistance at 2.36 for the 4th time, and also confirm support at 2.25-2.27. If it breaks through 2.3 and pushes a little further, guaranteed 2.5 is on its way very soon. Delta hedging will begin and a lot of buying will take place. There is a past resistance at 3 and 4.5.

 As of now, the ctb is decent, utilization also is somewhat high. 

Here’s my point. This thing runs with volume, and right now there’s 20k+ contracts for $2.5 and 20k+ for $5 expiration Jan 21st. As of now the 2.5 is $15 and the $5 is only $5.

I will attach a screenshot of the value chart for the $5 call, very crazy room for a massive play here in the options chain. It takes volume, but If we can make that happen there’s millions to be made here, just gotta get some volume going. Could turn $5 into $20 or $60 if this hits 2.6-2.7 on Monday.",1641670185

4432,wallstreetbets,How To Defend a Long Position You Got Caught Bagholding In,"So something that dawned on me the other day was, Ive often seen ppl holding huge positions at high cost basis' and wondered why they never did this but, recently I got stuck in a daytrade that went wrong. I made $2800 on it on the first go, $600 on it on the second go, and on the third go, I was out of daytrades so decided I was gonna ride it out overnight. 

Sweeeeeet.

It did exactly what you think. Retraced about 50-60% and I was holding bags near the top. The next day it was much less volume. Started getting bummed thinking Ill have to sit on this for centuries until the next news catalyst because I took my max share position, wasnt planning on bagholding or adding to my position at a lower cost basis to average down. It was daytrading. 

Then it hit me like diarrhea in the check out line.

I identified a support and resistance channel that its currently moving within. Im holding 3500 shares. If I sell 100 at the top of the channel, and buy 100 at the bottom of the channel, eventually, slowly but surely, I can cost average down without adding anymore to my position size, and I will also keep the majority of my position in the trade incase the bitch wants to get wild and run on me again. Yes, itll be micro losses compared to a large loss until I can get the cost basis down to within the channel, but I think this will translate to less loss and a profitable exit and Id like someone with at least one wrinkle in their brain to crunch the math on that if theyre up to it.

Eventually my cost basis will be down within that trading channel pending it holds that channel or goes up in the near future and I can exit my entire position at the top of that channel instead to secure my profit.

Maybe this is something you all already do. But I've seen some pretty hefty bag holding here and wondered why more ppl don't do this. Havent even seen it mentioned here to be honest. I dont know if it counts as basic averaging down since you arent really adding to you position size, just selling and rebuying a chunk of what you already own versus holding on until infinity hoping for a recovery.

[institutional ownership of the new York times https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/quote\/shareholders\/shareholders.html?symb=NYT&amp;subView=institutional](https://preview.redd.it/jr1zuhbhcia81.jpg?width=634&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a1e43115369e64f51ca9671ddfd25497763572f)

Is this because the NYT or news companies in general are so profitable? Well, while the NYT made a profit of 54.7 million, an increase from 33.6 million before I do not think that this is the actual reason. Rather the true value comes from elsewhere. If you own it you can decide which articles are published, which topics are covered and have influence on the narrative. I.e. owning these companies allows you to push out news that positively affect stocks you are long on and negatively affect stocks you shorted. This is were their actual value for institutions comes from.

Or do you think do you think stuff like this happens on coincidence?

Anyways, I think the same is true for Reddit. They already do this to some extent but owning the actual company will help to ""tighten"" their grip. There is a new fancy stock you want to pump and dump? Just push out some discussion on it on Reddit.

To most people NAKD is a meme pos stock BUT not so fast. They’ve essentially became a SPAC and acquired and light commercial electric EV company. New CEO some Chinese dude named WANG. 


They have some upcoming catalysts. 

One being a new factory in Jacksonville FL. Production should start around March. They are right next to JAXPORT. They are a global company and have already sold their product to 20+ countries. 

When word gets out that this is a cheap ev play and we are very early it could be uuuuvge.

4450,wallstreetbets,OMV AG is STILL undervalued.,"Sup, retards. I am spending a lot of time on Reddit lately (more that I should, and much more than is safe for my mental health) and I had noticed that no one here, ever, is talking about the oil. Seriously. Well, here it is. 

Brutal truth: big oil is fucked.  RDSA got roasted with a fine for human rights violation for daring to operate and prohibited from further exploration,  BP ceased to be an oil company, and the less is said about the US oil stocks, the better. Fed's are literally twitting ""we want them dead, broke and gone"". And if they are big, they will get a 100 billion fine for the greater justice. 

Where am I going with it? Well, hear me out. Not everything is so fucked in this world. There is an actual oil company out there (in truth, there are three), in Europe, that is still trying to be an oil company (and not a piece of green trash). It's Austrian, it has market cap of 17.7 billion. Dividend yield? 3-6%, and it is going up. 

And yes, it is still undervalued, currently going for 54.40 EUR, with a target price of 59.9 EUR. It is 60% gas, 40% oil, working upstream and downstream. Yes, it is vertically integrated and has refineries in half of the europe (the good half). It makes profit, it pays dividends increasing them by a year, and made it through the 2020s like a bandit. 

And, I remind you, winter is still not over. Europe is still fucked. Nord Stream is still not finished.  

Basically, just a heads up - there is an oil industry beyond Exxon and Chevron, even if you are unwilling to throw your money at Sinopec and CNOOC (though I do).",1641666972

4469,wallstreetbets,BBBY Due Dilly part 2 -- post FQ3 earnings results," Below is my summary after digesting the FQ3 call and earnings presentation. I have summarized into four buckets -- 1. Positives, 2. Negatives, 2. Other comments and 4. Catalysts that I believe will start to unfold over the coming year:

**Positive factors**

\- Strong customer demand

\- Achieved HSD comps growth from Black Friday to Cyber Monday à still a top destination for customers

\- Greater levels of in-store shopping versus prior year

\- Sales/traffic conversion in store and online were both solid

\- Continued to use promotions more strategically driving profitable customer engagement

o Coupon exclusions, fewer clearance discounts, event-driven coupons during key shopping periods

\- Corrected gross margin issues diagnosed in FQ2 with surgical dynamic pricing in FQ3

o 320 bps merchandise margin increase, more than offsetting 270 bps impact from higher freight

o Gross margins up from both 2020 and 2019 levels à **key financial barometer of 3-year strategy**

\- Continued double-digit growth in BuyBuyBaby à Expected to reach $1.3bn of sales by FY’21, which is ahead of company target from 2020 investor day, with improving profitability and market share

\- Achieved one of largest new member subscriber quarters on record à from 1.8mm to 2.2mm in FQ3’21

o Company did note use of reduced membership fees to gain broader adoption, but sees the lifetime value of customer (particularly across banner shopping) justifying the move

\- Declining adjustments to gross margins à only 30 bps differential from adjusted to reported gross margins

\- Store closure sales recapture rates continue to trend above investor day target of \~20%

\- Announced incremental $100mm SG&amp;A rationalization to ensure expense to sales ratio held in check given the headwind à combination of fleet optimization and fixed cost/discretionary cost outs

o Will not come from any of the key strategic investments supporting turnaround

**Negative factors**

\- Vendor constraints/locked inventory

\- Ill-equipped legacy infrastructure

**Other considerations**

\- Inability to meet demand with product availability due to inventory constraints (both vendor and company) accounted for approx. $100mm of YoY sales decline, virtually the entire negative comp

\- Inventory disruption issues continue to affect December (greater than MSD comp impact)

o Company was caught basically flat footed as turnaround strategy prioritized other investments in 2021 with plans to overhaul supply chain/infrastructure in 2022 à poor timing for this particular macro development to occur

\- Constraints also impacted marketing à while company reintroduced its offering circular (key traffic driver for web and store), paper/print supply constraints limited ability to reach full scale circular distribution

**Catalysts**

\- Remediation of inventory constraints

o Company has demonstrated ability to quickly remediate issues as they arise à diagnosed gross margin issues in FQ2 and implemented surgical dynamic pricing changes, driving solid gross margin performance in FQ3 à now turning attention to inventory constraints and elevating plans for sales acceleration in the near- and intermediate-term

o Implementing additional plans above and beyond investments highlighted in 2020 investor day

o Infrastructure modernization plans are expected to increase company’s agility to manage thru any future operating environment

o While broader macro inventory environment is not expected to be remediated in 1H’22, company does not expect impact to persist on BBBY thru 1H’22 given steps being taken

\- Cumulative impact of ramping remodeled stores/new remodels + owned brand penetration

o 80 remodels today à 130 by year end and 450 by 2023

o Existing remodels have positive mid-single-digits comp sales uplift and higher than average owned brand penetration (25% for overall)

o For owned brands, company was targeting 20% penetration by FY’21 and 30% by FY’23 assuming 10 owned brand launches, but already at 25% by FQ3’21 with only 80 stores remodeled

§ Should see greater ramping of existing remodels plus waterfall/layering of new remodels driving overall penetration above 25% BEFORE any additional owned brand launches

§ 2 more owned brand launches inside of original plan, with potential to launch more given how far ahead of schedule company is (8 launched in 2021)

\- Strategic transformation at BuyBuyBaby in 2022 (current margin differential from BBB banner creates a big opportunity to improve earnings at BuyBuyBaby using BBB margin playbook)

o Owned brand launches

o Kroger partnership and digital marketplace

\- New enhanced membership loyalty program this year (2022)

\- Incremental SG&amp;A optimization will drive \~$100mm of additional cost improvement, which could remain sticky as the company regains traction on the top-line

\- Entering fiscal 2022 with healthier store fleet, more solid base from which to grow

o Expects 2022 to be year of green shoots for market share expansion after deliberately downsizing store fleet in 2021. Bed Bath will be focus, as Baby already performing well

\- Share repurchases

o Existing program implies the share count will reach 75-85mm by end of February (wide range given the share price volatility)

o CFO hinted at additional share repurchases beyond that on the call (supported by the “TBD” label under FY’2022 in the share repurchase bar chart in FQ3 earnings presentation)

o CFO/CEO and Board continue to believe the intrinsic value of the business over the longer-term is significantly higher than prevailing stock price

\- Valuation considerations

o Company guidance for $850mm to $1bn of EBITDA implies net income of \~$385mm to \~$490mm, assuming \~$300mm for D&amp;A + interest expense and 30% tax rate à based on existing share count implies \~$4.00 to \~$5.10 of EPS by FY’2023 ($4.60 to $5.90 assuming 83mm shares by end of FY’21 and higher still assuming further share repurchases are announced)

§ Established big box and specialty retail peers (company sits at cross-section of these two groups) typically trade from around 15x PE to over 20x PE for best-in-class, but even deep distress multiples of 6-7x produce share prices approximately double today’s valuation

o Using sum-of-the-parts analysis, the prevailing valuation is likely far too cheap. With a market cap of about $1.35bn and a valuation of BuyBuyBaby that was estimated at \~$700mm by the activists, the implication is only \~$650mm for the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Harmon’s banners, which is less than the amount of cash on balance sheet today… the market pricing mechanism here appears to be broken – possibly driven moreso by sentiment rather than cold, calculated valuation, possibly manipulated by short sellers… who knows",1641665188

What this scenario might look like?,"I think a lot of us on this subreddit are concerned about what will happen to the market in 2022 or will there be a market crash due to ""the everything bubble""? I've read a number of posts and watched a greater number of videos dedicated to this topic and, I guess, I haven't found a good fundamental reason to ""why market might crash in 2022"".  


Usually when dicussing this topic, experts talk about the indicators that can tell you that there is a bubble about to burst. That includes a number of things:

* insanely high P/E ratios and market cap, overvalued companies that only promise to make money in the future
* growing popularity of investing, which leads to the emergance of a large number of new investors who trade rather irresponsible and stick to momentum trading strategy
* price growth, high inflation and federal reserve printing a lot of money

the list goes on...

&amp;#x200B;

But can someone tell me what might be the fundamental reason for a market crash? For example, if we look at year 2008, we can say that the reason was people not being able to pay their mortgage. After the floating rates came into force, the whole market went down. So what might be the ""2022 market crash"" scenario? What might happen?

4506,wallstreetbets,PYPL DD and Trading Plan,"TLDR:  PYPL 3/18 calls, any strike between 200-230

I'm not going to go into the background of PayPal and what not, I'm simply going to explain my view of the current landscape regarding the stock and where I think it's going in the next two months, as well as my play.  PYPL's massive slide began when the rumor that it was considering a buyout of PINS was debunked on October 20.  The selling continued until its earnings report on 9/8.  In that report, they beat on EPS but missed slightly on revenue.  They issued full year guidance that was lower than expected, citing supply chain issues and spending habit changes as the economy reopens.  This spooked investors further, and the sell off continued.  A widespread sell-off in fintech began, and, in my opinion, is about exhausted.  

There are a couple recent bullish points about PYPL.  The first, and most important, is the partnership with Amazon.  Starting sometime early this year, you can use Venmo to pay at Amazon.  This is huge for PayPal, and the reasons why can be found [here](https://thefinancialbrand.com/125358/amazon-venmo-paypal-p2p-payments-trends-walmart/).  PayPal also saw a 400% increase in their buy now, pay later option during November's Black Friday.  The company did 750,000 transactions alone on Block Friday, $1 billion in processing volume during the month of November, and added 1 million first-time users during the month for the first time ever([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/paypal-ceo-use-of-buy-now-pay-later-option-soared-on-black-friday.html)).  All of these metrics will be included in their earnings report on 2/2, which I think will be a beat.  Finally, they confirmed today that they will be launching their own stable corn([source](https://www.uptobrain.com/business/paypal-confirms-future-plan-to-launch-its-own-stablecoin/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=paypal-confirms-future-plan-to-launch-its-own-stablecoin)).  I don't really know much or care about corn, but there was a slight pop in the stock price Friday after market on the news so it may help give the stock a little momentum once we know more about it.  To me, it shows an overall continued push into the space, which is obviously growing exponentially and will be a significant future source of revenue.  

Now to the technicals.  The stock is down about 40% from its high of 310.  It has been range bound between 180-195 since November 22.  This is significant because it is the same channel it traded in from August-October of 2020.  The price slipped into the 170's a couple times during that period, but overall, buyers came in hard around the 180 mark, and I think the same is happening now.  The volume has continued to be elevated during the past few weeks of consolidation, indicating that accumulation is likely occurring.  I think this area is the floor for PYPL, its just a matter of how long it will tread water here. 

&amp;#x200B;

The RSI on the weekly is starting climb out of oversold territory, and the MACD is close to reversing bullish.  Also, you can see the continued elevated volume as the stock has stabilized. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7qqimhktfha81.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6f8bb421035c348717d34cc2d98863bbabe9c8

The bolliger bands are tightening up more so than they have since the black swan in 2020.  Volatility is low right now, and so is IV on calls.  Once again, you can see the increased volume in recent weeks while the price has been stable.  I think that these are buyers coming back in to play.  One last thing, the RSI on the daily has risen from 22 on December 1 to 50 on Friday.  During this time frame, the stock bounced around within the 180-195 price range.  A sharp rise is RSI while stock price remains relatively flat is usually a good sign that positive price action is coming.  

The biggest concern I have is simply that the selling is not done. You could argue that there is a bear flag forming, but I don't agree.  If we were seeing a sharp technical bounce with the price increasing, I would say bear flag.  But the price has been fairly flat, and looks more like consolidation to me.  Like I said in the previous paragraph, a drop to 170-175 is not out of the question, but I think thats the absolute floor.  Also, some news was released on Friday that payment processors will have to report earnings over $600 to the IRS for BUSINESS accounts, not personal accounts.  So you sending your friend cash for dinner or buying a gift on Amazon will not be affected.  It's only a change in reporting rules that the government is requiring from PayPal.  I don't think its a big deal, and its simply the government making sure people who run their businesses through companies like PayPal are paying taxes([source](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/fact-or-fiction-the-irs-is-tracking-payments-over-600-on-paypal-and-venmo-in-2022/)).  Finally, the indices have shown weakness.  If that weakness continues, everything else gets dragged down.  Just have to hope for the best there.  

Trading plan:  My position is 3/18 200 calls.  I bought 7 on Friday for $8.00 each. I'm watching for a break and hold above 196.  It's been rejected off that level twice so far.  After that, 216 is the next key level.  That number served as resistance on Nov 16 2021, as well as Oct 21, Nov 25, and Nov 30 back in 2020.  My target price is 230, and I will sell if it hits that.  That should be around a 400% or so gain.  I'm not saying this will run back to all time highs, although it has show in the  past that it can run hard, but a bounce to 230 after a 40% haircut is very reasonable.  If it dips to 170-175, I will double down with another $5,000 as my conviction is pretty high on this play.  If it breaks 165, I'm cutting my losses.  Earnings are on 2/2, and I will holding through them.  The stock has tanked on the last 2 earnings reports, and I don't see that trend continuing, especially with holiday numbers being reported and overall Black Friday sales nearly matching 2020's all time high.

4515,wallstreetbets,The Bullish case for the big US banks.,"Look I’m not some huge nerd who’s going to do financial and technical analysis, but none of you retards even understand that shit anyways.

My point is short and sweet. Interest rate hikes are coming, whether your bags want to hear that or not, it’s the truth. 60% chance of a rate hike coming as early as March. This couldn’t be more bullish for banks and here’s why. Banks offer like .1% interest on savings accounts and maybe like .3% on CDs, so they are essentially paying nothing to loan out consumer money. However, the interest rate hike now mean that while they’re still paying you shit for your money, now you have to pay a shit loan more interest on any loan you want to take out. Their profit margins almost double.

My two favorites atm are WFC and BAC, however JPM is the clear leader but they’re a bit expensive atm. All major banks are near ATHs but when has that stopped you fucks before. With these major catalysts I don’t think they’re done running up and I think they will easily blow past ATHs. 

Of course this isn’t financial advice as I have Aspergers, just my thoughts. 

Positions for anyone who cares. 7 WFC 1/28 52c and 10 BAC 1/28 48c",1641656755

And I’d like to short it.

My plan is to withdraw cash like 100$ from them and deposit it with a different bank then transfer it back to them and withdraw the same 100 $ until they run out of physical cash. I would then go around and let people know that when I tired withdrawing money from them that there was no cash to withdraw. 

This in turn should cause a bank run and I’m assuming a decent amount of people would close their accounts leading for the stock price to fall. 

Puts are extremely cheap and I would love for this bank to go out of business or lose public trust.

Poland, a country hailing from Europe neighboring all too well known countries like Belarus 🇧🇾 and Czechia 🇨🇿 as well as Belgium 🇧🇪 and Germany 🇩🇪 . Now, what do these things have in Common? Cramer, a known jester of the markets famous for crawling out of the naked mole rat society and beginning his fame in Wall Street Predictions, he has, been known, to be an indicator of companies doomed for red charts. Red, a symbol of economic decline in the stock market as well as, the color of Campbell cans and Campbells famous watery tomato soup full of preservatives, traces of lead and fluoride as well as inferior tomato product. What is also red? Well, Poland, the same name as their Chief supply Chain officer, has a red flag. What else has red flags? Only every neighboring country…are you beginning to see the connection? Campbell has involved itself with the color red more than any other color besides white, the leading skin color of Campbell customers, this is a clear indicator of a faulty company that needs to be shorted like AT&amp;T (T) which just recently saw a steady incline into the 26’s. Below are the charts I believe show true indication of a red future for Campbell and Mr.Poland. Puts on Campbell. Poland is also famous for Auschwitz, soup was probably fed to prisoners because it’s cheap and easy to fill with fillers. So if Daniel L. Poland, the Chief supply Chain officer, is now in charge of Campbell soup, I want nothing to do with it.

At this moment the warrant costs 4.75 usd.
100 warrants = 475 usd. 
Tesla strike price+Warrant costs= Breakeven price
The breakeven price would therefore be 475+620=1095.

It was not a surprise to see Biitcoin wick down to the $40.6k area yesterday, after a weak reaction from the previous areas of support.

We can still expect to have a good alt run in the coming weeks, and we are already seeing signs of that with many coins holding strong.

The more DD I read about the fuckery and crime that went on in January 2021 right up until the current day and the fact that it has only become clearer as to yes it will squeeze. My tits are jacked as they say and I don't really know how to manage my daydreaming and often slip in and out of Zen. I'm often feeling that this is going to be a ping pong game of up and down average prices forever until we either die of natural causes or simply pull out due to life's financial stresses and emergencies that may arise. Which is what they want.

My question to you all is could the price theoretically be held in a certain range forever with the help of crime and fuckery on their end? 

If this squeeze IS to go down what would be stopping the government itself stepping in and pretty much (in a much more technical way) saying for everyone to fuck off and then patting their HF mates on the back?

I like the stock. That is a definite. But I suppose my brain that has been conditioned to be forever poor/middle class at best is playing it's own fuckery on me lately. Telling me that I'm dreaming and that as if I'm alive at a time when I could be a part of history and make bank on it too.

(DD and positions inside)","Okay so I played the run up last year too but I believe this year's meme stock will be even crazier. The manipulation going on not just with the stock price but with the media is just disgusting. Reddit going down 2 days ago and having 30k upvotes REMOVED off the video of a Wallstreet veteran talking about how the BUY BUTTON was removed last year for buying these stocks and how there have been no consequences for the manipulation of these stocks by C itadel's naked shorting of G M E as well as the use of synthetic shorts and stock pinning (like they did on  A M C today).

Info: https://i.imgur.com/xwmLCMY.png https://i.imgur.com/WiGbPCK.png

On the A M C  note, https://i.imgur.com/eZnNkOb.png

There were 35k of Open Interest $23 strike puts expiring today. Right at the close from 3:50 PM EST till 4:00 PM EST the price was tinkering in between $22.99 and $23.01. Till it seemingly closed at $23.11. Which means those put contracts expired worthless (they wouldn't be assigned and there would be no new short shares). Instead the $23 strike calls would be ITM and people would have to buy shares at that price. Instead, after market close, every brokerage and even Google, Yahoo Finance, Trading View, etc was giving a different closing price. But go on your brokerage now and check the closing price candle for 4:00 PM EST on A M C. It's showing above $23 everywhere. But they ""adjusted"" it to $22.99 (manipulated it and sent an order for that price a split second before market close somehow) and 3.5 million shares were shorted due to the $23 strike puts expiring ITM.

Now back to the other topic. The thread in which the guy was calling out C itadel and others for the naked shorts and manipulation of G M E was gaining momentum and upvotes super fast (30k upvotes real quick) and was on the frontpage before reddit had a ""glitch"" and the server went down, then 10s of thousands of upvotes on it went ""missing"". But yeah nothing to see here, just tinfoil hats and coincidences along with the AH squeeze then ending the day with red on both stocks.

And there is the video itself on YouTube incase anything gets removed again.

Oh and G M E spiking 30% after hours yesterday and A M C 15% respectively? Nah, don't worry about it. It's nothing. It totally wasn't an unofficial leak from the WSJ of the work G M E is doing on the NFT marketplace but has chose to not release yet. Why would they do that though? Hmm i.imgur.c om/fIwBAVJ.jpg

Honestly I could keep writing more and more of their disgusting acts, but leaning on the side of not regurgitating what everyone knows about this fraudulent market and how they are manipulating the stock, news, and social media websites to scare retails away into not causing another short squeeze and gamma squeeze so they can keep naked shorting these stocks and getting away with huge profits, I will just let you make the decision on this yourself.

Will we see a repeat and an even bigger squeeze this year? That's what everything looks like it's leading up to!

4673,wallstreetbets,COIN DD - Earnings don't matter,"*I realize I'm toeing the line on one of the submission rules here regarding coins, so I'm going to include fancy numbers, quality DD and only use $$$'s in my numbers.*

Here's my thesis: COIN earnings don't matter because it's an asset play. People deposit money into COIN when they want to buy coins. Only the savvy currency owners actually *withdraw* the currency into a hardware wallet. Meaning, money goes in. Money stays there. Money doesn't come out. Where does it go?

It goes on their balance sheet. And boy oh boy, look at that balance sheet. These are their current assets in the last four quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

||12/31/2020|3/31/2020|6/30/2021|9/30/2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Assets ($B)|**5.86**|**10.2**|**15.8**|**18.4**|

&amp;#x200B;

These numbers are in Billions per quarter! Let that sink in. After already having $6B in assets at the beginning of the year, they tripled them in less than 4 quarters!!! $12.5B of asset expansion is more than many banks.

Unlike before, where COIN heavily relied on the ""C"" word for shoring up its balance sheet, now COIN has diversified both its revenue and assets. It also has a lot of ""intangible"" assets not on the balance sheet because exchanges like COIN often get fresh mints of new currency, along with a floating supply to maintain liquidity. So you as an investor have exposure without any of the risk because it's like owning the S&amp;P500 of an alternate digital universe.

Oh and since everyone here hates Robinhood so much for charging up the price by $0.01, COIN does that. Oh, and it also charges fees. But nobody has any choice because all the other exchanges are run by a bunch of sleaze bags. COIN will be the most underrated investment of 2022.",1641621365

4676,wallstreetbets,A story of impatience. What’s yours?,"I originally shared this story as a comment to a post…

Might as well share it more broadly. Not financial advice… clearly.

I think I belong here.

I had built up 50K in the span of around 3 months, putting in 50-60 hours of research and trading every week. Getting up at 3am for trading on Webull, making some losses, but mostly winning with well researched investments. I used margin, but I was confident with my research, and everything went okay.

Until I decided to invest in a certain clothing retailer on somewhat of a whim.

I figured, hey, I liked the brand well enough, let’s do one more earnings play.

Then I’ll cash out and invest more responsibly.

One more time, all in.

Margin ended up bringing my total investment to almost 100K. Earnings were okay, but the markets did not respond well. I got margin called, but hoped it would bounce back up after the overreaction, as I’d seen multiple times before. No such joy would be found. It continued to tank, and my investment was forcefully liquidated at market close.

That ticker continued to tank for about a year until it finally began an uptrend again.

I tried to make the money back quickly. I had some experience with options, and I did some weeklies. First one is free, right? I made around 20K with a smart 3K investment on another earnings play. I had done my research.

Then I got impatient, tried again without all the research, lost it again.

I would continue to grow impatient and skip from ticker to ticker. My research ended up being sound, with gains that would have been anywhere from 2-10x in a matter of months. But I never waited that long.

Oh, and I had built up around 20K in credit card debt that I was planning to pay off with the initial 50K~ in gains. Fun times.

What’s your story? Sharing loss can be cathartic. 😅

Here’s some of my brokerage breakdowns:
* E*T: 2y -96.6%
* RH All Time: -94.85%

4689,wallstreetbets,Stock Market PSA,"It's the first week of the new year and the Fed has told you what they are going to do.

They are going to stop buying bonds and allow rates to rise. This will mean that risk assets will fall and credit crunches will become a possibility.

When both of these happen your meme stocks and other dumb digital speculative assets will fall in price. Read that again. They WILL fall in price.

Ark invest has already seen a huge decline in value over the last 12 months while it's poster child for growth Tesla has been stable (even though your favorite Tweeter dumped bags on his followers).

The declines seen so far are no coincidence. Neither is the fact that there will be a drawn down in the markets this year. It's not some guess. It is a reality. As real as the sun coming up in the morning and Elon Tweeting nonsense during the Olympics. They will happen. Well all know.

Now you might ask why I am posting this even I know I'll get downvotes from a bunch of mouth breathers that think that hope is a strategy and that Peter Pan is someone to listen to when speculating in GameStop. No Tinkerbell it doesn't just happen if you believe.

Well, the reason is that if just one of you dodges the steamroller coming for your life savings then it would be worth it. Lots of you retards will lose your shirt. Not just tendies. But a significant portion of your life's savings. 

And getting that savings back won't be the result of holding bags for eight weeks until the government bails you out. That nonsense is over. You're going to actually have to work for it. A job at Starbucks. Creating an only fans for your pets. Donating plasma to the Koch's.

So do the smart thing and sell your memes. And do an even smarter thing and get a job before they are all gone. Seriously, the world is about to change. And it's not going to be pretty.

4722,wallstreetbets,Moderna is probably the most vulnerable COVID vaccine company right now and why an aggressive short might make sense.,"Moderna is the example of a small company that has its entire wealth built around one thing: mRNA COVID vaccines. Before COVID, this company was on the brink of bankruptcy. As COVID vaccines reveal themselves to be much less efficacious that initially marketed and as Moderna vaccines are said to induce pretty severe side effects notably (see recommendations against it for young males in Europe), I see a potential aggressive short in this stock for 2022. They have a great ally though, and it's one of their patent holder: Anthony Fauci. But Fauci might become a handicap in the future for his potential role into gain of function research in China, his lies to Congress and his conflict of interests that absolutely no one can ignore. His fall into total disgrace might just be a matter of time (hopefully) and might drag Moderna with it. I could see the CEO progressively trying to exit. The dominoes might fall very quickly if it happens.
On the other side, the risk to the upside still exist. Moderna might manage to push other types of vaccines (cancer? other illnesses?) after its success in the COVID vaccines industry. Fauci might also manage to drag his possible prosecutions and remember, he has powerful allies himself.
Pfizer is another element to take into account. Moderna's main rival has a potential safe exit: their treatment named Paxlovid. Once Paxlovid is confirmed to be able to flood the world with a high price tag, Pfizer might not see the current vaccine propaganda to be as useful.
Another threat to Moderna is the actual development of a variant resistant vaccine. An example: https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2021/12/us-army-creates-single-vaccine-effective-against-all-covid-sars-variants/360089/",1641613388

The math here is 48M shares to start. From this amount, 32M were redeemed prior to the merger last week. 10M are founders shares. This leaves only 6M available to the public, for atleast the next 3 weeks. 

The PIPE is locked up for 180 days as well. 0 shares available to short at the moment, but even when they start the float is so small that it might be a tough cover for them if bulls just buy and hold. Similar to what we saw last year with IRNT, BKKT, and IONQ to name a few.

A brief summary of the company, VORB is Virgin Orbit. It was spun off from Virgin Galactic a few years ago by Sir Richard Branson. This is the first full week VORB is trading as a public company. It's focus is launching satellites and national defense, as part if the space sector. 

To go into more detail, VORB has a modified Boeing 747-400 airplane that replaced one engine under its wing, with a giant pylon clamp. They build rockets at the factory, clamp them onto the airplane, and drop the rockets during the flight. The rockets then self ignite after 5 seconds in the air and use liquid oxygen to propel into space. Once in space, it deploys the customer satellites into precise orbits. 

This is a global business, not just limited to the USA. They have racked up several partnerships both domestic and international, for both government and commercial customers. Some of their contracts include, but are not limited to, US Space Force, US Dept of Defense, NASA, United Kingdom Space Force, ANA Holdings Japan, Brazil Space, Redwire, Spire, Arqitt, HyperSat, SatRevolution, Horizon Tech to name a few. They are also working on being building their own satellites and becoming a full end to end space service provider. 

So that is 6M float, for a rapid response air launcher, that can turn any airport into a launch pad, with a $16 initial price target issued by Benchmark, with current share price of around $8 at end of day Friday 1/7/2022. And VORBW are the warrants with a 5 year expiration and and at only $1.20. Lastly, they will have 6 launches in 2022, with the next window opening for Wednesday 1/12/2022.",1641609618

4750,wallstreetbets,A Profitable Microcap With a Solid Balance Sheet,"$APT (Alpha Pro Tech) is a 40 year established seller of disposable PPE and woven building materials. $APT saw enormous growth and success in 2020 at the height of the pandemic. Their long predictable $45 million annual revenue more than doubled to over $100 million in 2020. Naturally as pandemic PPE supply caught up as demand softened, $APT gave back some of that growth and has seen sales of $55.5 million for Q1-Q3 of 2021 and $84.5 million on a trailing twelve month basis. The market has not been kind to the stock and they sit near a current market cap of $80 million with just over 13 million shares outstanding:

**PART 1: VALUE**

Pull up a snapshot from any market data aggregator and you’ll see some of the hallmarks of a value play: P/E of 6.1, no debt, near 52 week lows etc. If we pull back the curtain and dig down, that value proposition may be even stronger than it first appears. I’ll focus purely on the balance sheet here and look at income potential in Part 2.

First, take in the book value (assets minus liabilities) as of Q3: **$62.7 million**. This represents the accounting hypothetical value if the company were to shut down tomorrow, pay off everything they owe, and **liquidate** everything they own. No future cash flows, no growth, nothing looking to the future. It’s like calculating your net worth if you were to die tomorrow and your heirs were crackheads that pawned everything for a few weeks of speedballs. Already with this hyper pessimistic scenario, we have accounted for a valuation of $4.67 per fully diluted share ($62.7 million / 13,419,485 diluted shares) in a shut down and liquidate scenario. But APT isn’t shutting down or liquidating. Is there more present-day-shareholder-meaningful value than what the accountants are allowed to recognize on the balance sheet?

They held $23.2 million in inventory at last report. But that doesn’t translate to $23.2 million in cash after this inventory is sold. Remember from GAAP: inventory must be carried at the lower of cost or expected net realizable value. We can infer from management comments that the bulk of this inventory is in the mask and PPE segment and not building supplies and wraps (where they are expanding capacity because they can’t keep up with orders). PPE is a much higher margin segment for $APT. Gross margins on PPE have been close to 50%, but lets apply the pre-covid 35% margin for some realistic conservatism. The cash that inventory will be converted to when sold: $23.2 million \* 1.35 = **$31.3 million conservatively estimated future cash flows from existing inventory.** That is $8.1 million over crackhead book value. Another $0.60 to give us $5.27 per share so far.

***Isn’t covid waning and they might need to steeply discount or write down that inventory when they can’t sell it?***

$APT owns a chunk of another company? Head back over to the Q3 10-Q filing from the link above and go to section 7 (bottom of page 8).

*“In 2005, Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc. (a subsidiary of Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd.) entered into a joint venture with a manufacturer in India, Maple Industries and associates, for the production of building products. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, a private company, Harmony Plastics Private Limited (“Harmony”), was created with ownership interests of 41.66% owned by Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc. and 58.34% owned by Maple Industries and associates….In addition, the joint venture now supplies products for the Disposable Protective Apparel segment.”*

**Translation:** $APT has the domestic manufacturing facilities we know about **but also deeper under-the-radar vertical integration with 41% ownership in their largest offshore supplier**. Vertical integration meaning $APT owns or holds a large stake in everything from the procurement of raw materials overseas all the way through to sales to their domestic customer. That’s a leg up on the competition for the next few years while supply chains are shit.

Why $6 million on the balance sheet today? Once again, GAAP forces you to carry it at the lowest possible number. Carrying value is their initial investment ($1,450,000) plus a 41% share of net income. Based on the run rate growth on the balance sheet, **$APT’s share of Harmony’s net income is at about $800k per year**. A 10-15x multiple on those earnings is already much more than the current $6 million on the balance sheet.

But do you think Harmony sells to $APT, a 41% owner, at full list price? Of course not! Harmony’s net income is undoubtedly trimmed by sweetheart deals for their largest customer and 41% owner. Has Harmony ever told $APT “Sorry, we booked all of our capacity for other customers” or handed $APT a stack of red tape to fill out for a defect or error with an order? Hell no! There are synergies and benefits that $APT gets to reap every single day from this partner. But they don’t get to recognize those expected future benefits on the balance sheet. So how do we value this stake? It is subjective but even if liquidated to a competitor, it sure as shit would be a hell of a lot more than $6 million given the nearly $1 million share of annual income + all of the other benefits. It’s perfectly reasonable, imo, to tack on another $1.00 per share to the balance sheet of $APT based on this ownership.

So we’ve got $4.67 per share in crackhead value + $0.55 in semi discounted inventory already on hand + $1.00 from a sweet partnership that they can’t fully recognize. That’s about $6.20 per share, a premium on the current price. **Let that sink in: the current share price is probably undervalued if all they did was sell off their existing inventory, divest their Harmony stake, then shut down and get high all day.**

But Jay and Silent Bob don’t run $APT and $6.20 isn't the final fair value. Let’s look to the future to see what lies ahead for $APT to layer more value on top of that liquidation scenario.

**Part 2: Growth**

I think we all agree: $APT has passed their pandemic sales peak for PPE. But is covid done juicing these beaten down shares? Maybe not.

In the inventory section above, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that a new baseline of PPE sales will remain materially higher than pre-pandemic levels with research reports suggesting a new normal where we get back to positive industry growth from 2021 going forward. Add the Omicron surge of the last month and new mask mandates and there is reason to believe we might see some new life from that segment. But don’t take my speculative word for it. **Read this excerpt from the CEO of a PPE competitor $LAKE. He had this to say on 12/9 for the earnings call for their quarter ending 10/31 (weird corporate calendar):**

*Previously, we anticipated that COVID driven sales would continue to diminish quarter-over-quarter as the pandemic ran to its conclusion. But this is not the case in Q3. Third quarter fiscal year '22, COVID 19 sales were an estimated $6 million or 20% of revenue, compared to our second quarter fiscal year '22 COVID sales of $3.5 million or 13% of revenue.* ***This is a significant deviation from our expectation for a continuous decline in pandemic related sales***\*.”\*

$LAKE has a significantly different geo mix of covid PPE sales compared to $APT. I would not count on $APT beating by 70% as $LAKE did. But it could be a sign of a wider bouncein this industry, or at least a slow down in the projected declines.

$APT may have tipped their hand with the announcement of the expansion of the buyback just before the end of the 4th quarter. Could better than expected PPE revenues coming in for Q4 (like $LAKE saw) have influenced getting that expansion of the program started while the share price is low before the next earnings release stirs the pot? We won’t know for sure until the annual report drops. But the tea leaves have me looking forward to the next earnings release. Any PPE related tailwinds in the near term are going to help add fuel to the expansion of the segment of the business: Building Supplies.

$APT’s bread and butter has been PPE for years. But it’s the woven building supply segment that opens up longer term value for shareholders. Historically a smaller percentage of sales on thinner margins, building supply has come to life over the last year with margin expansion to support it.

*“We continue to be optimistic regarding our expectation for continued growth in future periods and have committed to increasing production capacity for the Building Supply segment by investing approximately $4.0 million in new equipment, part of which became operational in the latter part of the third quarter of 2021 and began to contribute to the record sales quarter. As a result of a delay in the supply chain, the most expensive piece of equipment is now anticipated to arrive in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2021 and is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2022, which will add additional capacity for future growth”*

**For reference, $APT historically has spent $2.0-2.5 million on CAPEX per year. They just dropped $4 million on equipment that is coming online as we speak to power the expansion of the future of this business.** They are all in and don’t give a shit what you think about it. Maybe those segment growth assumptions above will turn out to be conservative…

**Fair Value Scoreboard (so far):**

**Balance sheet today:** $6.20 per share

**Building supply segment:** $6-$12 per share

**PPE segment:** $1-$5 per share (a guess depending where covid takes us, call it $0 if you want)

**Fair Value Range:** $13.20 to $23.20 per share (120% to 388% upside)

**Part 3: Buybacks are Religion at $APT**

We’ve looked at valuations so far through the lens of 13.4 million fully diluted shares. However, there is one thing $APT has always done and probably always will do. Burn shares like a post IPO biotech small cap burns cash. 2012 started with over 21 million shares outstanding. Pre-covid, during covid, post-covid, doesn’t matter. If they’ve got working capital where it needs to be, they’re using the rest of their cash to buy back shares. Book it.

Don’t expect this to change anytime soon. Despite all the price action over the last year while holding 1.5 million shares, the board and C-Suite have barely sold anything over the last year.

This recent price drop to sub $6 has been a gift to the buyback program and the board knows it. As mentioned above, they just added another $2 million to the buyback tranche on a day that the market closed at $5.35. If history is any indicator, they have probably aggressively spent a good chunk of that allocation in just the last few weeks as prices hover around 52 week lows. This allocation could eat away 300k to 400k shares from the outstanding count. I estimate that we will see share counts of approximately 13.1 million fully diluted with 12.8 million outstanding when the most recent counts are disclosed with the next filing.

So go ahead and tack on another 2-3% on our per share valuation today because these babies are drying up like Lake Oroville. While a foregone conclusion that a new buyback allocation will be approved and declared, probably in the next few quarters, its impact will be limited by the share price at the time that the funds are deployed. So let’s stick to 3% total adjustment on our valuation with emphasis on the very opportunistic move in December but know there is gravy here.

**Share Count Adjusted Fair Value Range:** $13.60 - $23.90.

**Part 4: Shorts will fall on their swords**

Sorry, but it wouldn’t be Reddit without some squeeze talk. If you buy half of what I’ve dropped here so far, you might be surprised to learn that short interest is rising quickly with these positive catalysts lurking.

Shorting has been beaten to death over the last year, so I’ll keep this quick.

$APT has been building short interest up in to the double digits percentages on its way down to near the 52 week low (which is close to book value). The last time $APT caught a little tailwind on some volume, shorts doubled down hard and smashed the rally.

Shorting a rally happens all the time. Why is that of interest for $APT and why should you see this as bullish?

For one, you’ve got the backdrop of the balance sheet that will support prices near current levels. Additional shorting at this price is like trying to short a SPAC at its $10 NAV. Second, is something called the maintenance margin requirement. You might have heard a lot about the direct incurred when borrowing shares. But there is another component associated with shorting, the cash you have to hold on hand to back up your short play. **These rates for $APT are through the roof! Most stocks sit at a 100% requirement, but $APT maintenance rate is 200% on IBKR and 300% on Fidelity.** That is not just opportunity cost for putting cash on the sideline. **It is also a big margin call risk.** As the price of $APT increases, the margin required to back up the position rises multiple times faster than a typical short position. Now the 10-12% estimated short interest punches above its weight.

Any attempt to fight back on the next rally risks drying up the few shares remaining to borrow and could trigger a spike in cost to borrow shares and a full on squeeze.

**Part 5: The options chain is LOADED after last week’s action**

Check out that volume for the big price swing days in Part 4 above. Shit got moving for a few days before the shorts fought to knock it down. And what do retail investors do when they chase a stock? That’s right, they load up on OTM calls!

For the savvy investor, such as yourself, this is great news! Now that prices have found support at pre-rally levels for a few days, the IV and premiums on options have come back to the same entry points you thought you missed last week. And even better: the open interest from the volume last week hasn't churned out. The options chain is coiled with open interest that wasn't there during round one. How often do you get a second chance like this?

**The promised TLDR;**

**$APT is a value play -** Their balance sheet alone is worth at least as much as the current share price especially after you dig in on the make up of their inventory and their joint venture with Harmony.

**$APT is a growth play** \- Covid may have one last run that pushes some high margin PPE revenue for $APT. More importantly, the building materials business is starting to take off. A discounted cash flow analysis shows this segment of the business alone could be worth $10 or more today. If we stop here, my DCF analysis gives a fair value range for $APT of $14 to $25 based on a range of plausible scenarios. But we’re not stopping here:

**$APT loves its shareholders** \- The board and executives love to buy back stock because they love to accumulate stock. They have been buying back shares like clockwork for over 10 years and have killed 40% of the shares that existed in 2011. They are dialing up the buy back while prices are low to eat away more shares and shares outstanding are likely approaching 13 million flat. The chances of an equity offering or large dilution anytime soon is virtually 0.

**$APT was shorted by masochists -** Last week’s sudden pop in short interest to defend a ridiculously low price with high maintenance margin was probably a bad call. There is little runway left for further shorting without risking a full on squeeze. At worst, the SI will be an unwind that helps push the price above the current near-book-value levels. And the best case: Things get squeezy.

**$APT had its option chain loaded up for expirations right around the corner** \- The OI/Delta/Gamma dynamic looks vulnerable. Especially for January 7th, just a few days to expiration. MM hedging against even a modest price run could start some violent price action.

**Conclusion:** $APT as a squeeze, a swing, or a decade... You’ve got a good chance of being happy with the outcome.

4762,wallstreetbets,I will never never financially recover from this… Cathie Wood is a fraud,"In November of 2020, I was in six figure debt from a failed business that got shut down due to COVID. I didn’t have enough money to pay my debt so I started looking around to see what I could do to help my bills.

Thanks to some finance YouTubers, I came across Cathie Wood. I was skeptical at first but the YouTubers were hyping her up as the next Warren Buffett - the next money tree who can 3x my investment in a year. So I started digging into ARK. On an update back in early 2021, Cathie Wood started mentioning how her fund is poised for lots of growth and outperformance of the market. Foolishly, I thought that if she’s saying it it must mean she’s guaranteeing these returns for her investors. So without thinking twice, I put money into ARK. 

But the fund kept going down. I was concerned so I started reading more of the ARK research and the YouTube videos that Cathie wood posts. She kept talking about how the fund will turn around… how innovation is king and how their macro outlook is the most correct. She kept talking about how the market has got it all wrong. These were posted by Cathie wood herself so I thought wow this must mean that things will shift around soon. I kept dumping money into ARK. Every month from then on, she kept talking about how things will turn around, and I kept adding. Then I look at my account in December and I’ve lost almost half my money. 

Turns out Cathie wood has been lying all along. She is a blatant fraud who claimed her macro outlook was right when it wasn’t. She kept claiming innovation will do well in 2021 when she knew she was wrong all along. She lied about how her ETF will somehow outperform. This is clear investor fraud and we must file a lawsuit ASAP. I need the money immediately to pay back my debt. Sell her ETFs now, so I can buy it for even lower!

#The most searched about financial symbol on the globe [AMC]has in fact an behemoth of new potential investors.Google searches represent thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands per night equating to multi millions per year. The pool to get new money in is literally endless. This does not even count hedge funds who are looking use this as an opportunity for exploiting, hence the sudden swing to positive news. 

A message to short sellers : be careful how low you bring this price down, the potential to double down and attract millions more on any given small catalyst will create a bigger swing then June. 

Good luck this is a casino and I'm sure there is allot of ichy fingers. 

AMC stock is the number #2 most popular search on Google News and the #7 most popular search on all of Google for 2021, 

This is HUGE. 

Innocently you may reshare a negative  link or even click on it just because the title made you angry.

I know there might be a study that shows we are more likely to click on controversial topics that contradict our view  point.  

There is for sure one that suggest the majority will even share an article without even reading it just because of the headlines 

( i will bring forth the studies soon ) 




Anyways its just interesting to reflect upon how much money those clicks  generated for media.. 

#This is also horrible news for short positions, 

It seems that as long as we keep AMC a HOT topic the more media speaks the more clicks and more potential new lurkers and FOMO buy. 

Even if the price drops clearly,  interest is HUGE. How do we know ? Perhaps the effects of Spiderman's monumental record breaking sales. Also, the involvement of NFT and noise. This is all thanks to the AMC crowd, EVEN IF THE PRICE WAS AT A 6 MONTHS LOW OF 20S. 

#This shows clearly that price is not reflective of interest. 


AMC is going to gain steam in 2022 

Listen up, 

You and I both know technicals are NOT a good indicator of price movement for AMC and GME.  If you retards understand this do you think hedge funds don't? They know .


So how do they know when to short and when to buy ? ... they don't ... their best bet is sentiment.... and oh boy are they watching... billions are on the line.... if they aren't.... surely algorythns are. 

And there it is... sentiment.... 

A matter of what society thinks and how much they are willing to risk for what they think. The perception that creates reality. 

Now I know what you are thinking, *but all I see is rockets and diamond hands on social media, bullish signals on stockwitz and bullshit youtube videos, the sentiment is bullshit to the moon we go* 

Yes you are right, however sentiment is not based only on social media. 


1. Social media ( positive ) 

2. FAKE news media ( negative and constantly  highly  critical reminding you to sell everyday, this is a HUGE factor  ) 

So 1 postive , 1 negative 

.... 
3. Environment : ( negative  with a twist ) example of environmental factors that affect sentiment would be :  *Omicron* which created panic  to the global financial market and gives a reason to short  a stock, it is immune to rocket and diamond emojis . On the other hand environmental factor can  change pretty fucking quickly... wait until its summer time and ther risk no Corona again ... like last June.... remember June? Oh ya a run up. 

Another negative but with a twist. 

4. Option chains ( postive with a twist )   those are still considered sentiment IMO because they are based on future predictions of how people feel . In this case they are constantly bullish but rely heavily on catalysts and when shit goes south it goes south quickly. 

Every one of your posts is a counted for algorythns have already infiltrated this subbreddit. They accounted for your bias when  putting diamond hands and rocket emojiss , when they filter those out they get to the bottom of how you are truly feeling. Are you that odd person who posted a serious concern about the effects of the omicron variant on  the movie industry ? If so it has been calculated. 

When the price drops ..oh does it ... drop   but this is the most searched  financial stocks symbol in the globe in terms of Google searches.  There are  MILLIOnS of lurkers waiting to click the buy button.  When the algorythms start detecting an influx of postive news cycles , social media posts  even after bias filtering AND  environmental factors... then you'll have a june run up only this time much bigger because of the constant influx of new AMC holders  who constantly increase in numbers. I am not speaking of total number of AMC shareholders but the percentage  of AMC holders which turns  to the following moto: 

- BUY AND HOLD - DIAMOND HANDS -IM HERE TO STAY - PAY ME BITCH - YOU SAID I WAS A RETARD, LET ME SHOW YOU HOW STUPID I AM.

4767,wallstreetbets,Bull thesis on Exelon Corporation $EXC,"TLDR at the bottom

Exelon is a Fortune 100 company that work​s in every stage of the energ​​​​y business: power generation, competitive energy sales, transmission and delivery with revenues of $33 billion​​. It is also the largest provider of carbon free energy having the largest nuclear fleet in the US. 

Recently Exelon’s share price has taken a hit due to unfavorable energy prices that have been surprised by a decade of cheap natural gas prices and a bloated balance sheet which is has significant liabilities coming due this year. 

https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nasdaq-exc/exelon/news/does-exelon-nasdaqexc-have-a-healthy-balance-sheet-1

Exelon runs a number of healthy utility companies that focus of transmission and delivery energy that have had a number of favorable rate cases over the years. Exelon has however not managed it’s generation business well and recently decided to spin off Exelon Generation and it’s sales business Constellation to derisk its business and with it  dumping a lot of its debt (which currently sits with the generation assets) into a new company so it can focus solely on its regulated utility business. 

https://www.pottsmerc.com/2021/11/22/exelon-moving-nuclear-plants-to-spin-off-company/amp/


Exelon has released its separation from Exelon generation will happen Feb 1st naming the new board of directors and analyst day.

https://www.exeloncorp.com/newsroom/new-constellation-board-of-directors-named

Exelon’s remaining utility business that house seven regulated utilities in the Midwest and Northeast will use its $27 billion capital investment plan to support 7.5% annual rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth.

https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/exc/quote

Corvex Management, an activist investor, estimated in October the company could be worth about $60 a share if it separates its assets. Exelon said in November it was conducting a review of its operations and that it had advisers to evaluate such a move.

https://www.bloombergquint.com/amp/business/exelon-plans-to-separate-power-generation-business-via-spinoff

Exelon also stands to benefit heavily from the build back better plan but taking advantage of its 11 billion dollars for reliability projects on the grid

https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-the-infrastructure-bill-could-change-doe-nuclear-grid/


TLDR 
Exelon share price is being depressed by its generation fleets debt and poor energy prices due to natural gas. Exelon is separating it’s regulated utility business away from its generation business which will remove a significant amount of debt from its balance sheet and derisk it business from volitive energy prices. There is a current investment opportunity to buy Exelon at its declined current price or purchase dirt cheap
Options and ride the upside wave after its separation on Feb 1.

Looking for some solid, logical DD on GME and the potential return against inflation &amp; market dynamics with the Fed raising rates soon. We've held since RH pulled the plug on trading last year in solidarity with you guys and because I had done tons of DD to believe it was the right move. Fast forward a year and with inflation on the rise, GME struggling to make money from sales &amp; revenue, along with higher rates from the Fed bringing the overall market down, my wife wants solid &amp; logical reasoning why we should still be holding GME. We both trade on the account, but she does it far more than I, so she has more authority to buy or sell and is perfectly within her rights to ask for reasoning on keeping the stock through all of the market headwinds.

I haven't kept up with the DD for awhile since I've been busy with life and was hoping you guys could give me a quick rundown on all the most recent DD for keeping the stock. Saying Rocket, bananas, TO THE MOON isn't gonna work for me. Wife has the mind of a steel trap and used to work for Goldman Sachs, so I need some solid, logical arguments. Help a fellow Ape out!

4870,wallstreetbets,Seeking inputs/DD: Is Robinhood Markets (Hood) a good buy at $15-$16?,"It seems there are quite a polarized group of people talking about Robinhood. Here are the upside and downside drivers/signals I see at the moment:

**Upside drivers/ signals**

Arc investments have taken a $25M position when the stock price was $25 and it's down 40% since then, though. 

The consensus analyst forecast also seems relatively healthy (Source: CNN Money):

* Low: $17
* Medium: $38
* High: $58

The Robinhood app still have a massive user base.

There is still a ton of headroom in blockchain for Robinhood.

**Downside drivers/ signals**

Too much negativity about the company and management team/ founders. One of the co-founders stepped down as the co-CEO. Is the management strength fading away?

As a company, Robinhood has had a bumpy ride for the last several quarters - so at what point do they loose focus and stamina?

Don't hear much innovation/ new offerings. Digital assets gifting one sounds a cute idea as opposed to something major.

Increasing competition

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have certainly missed a lot more signals and may be misinterpreting some so looking for thoughts from this community before taking a position in the HOOD!

Thanks in advance!",1641594120

To clarify, there are only 2 ways to compound with stock investments

1) Reinvesting dividend yield stocks

2) Selling and reinvesting in stocks with capital gains

Is that correct?

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

1. With the taxes you have to pay for capital gains - has anyone also calculated that unless you're having more than 20% gains, it's not worth to sell then rebuy to compound? (vs just holding and gaining simple interest) --&gt; anyone know how buffet took advantage of compound?

2. Do mutual funds have some other advantage than buying individual stocks other than diversifying? - they are essentially reinvesting dividends or capital gains when they sell, correct?",1641593248

Hopeful because lot of folks still believe news and news is fake. \~1M shares traded 2-3 mins before that long publication which gme did not confirm.

4909,wallstreetbets,i SPY more dip,"where are we and where are we going?

yesterday we finished the day with a green doji candle. we could have went either way really today. historically speaking a doji after a dip usually resulted in a big green day. that absolutely didnt happen today. today we traded between the 20 day EMA and 50 EMA. Early morning we saw the test and rejection of the 20 ema. we shortly after saw the test and rejection of breaking the 50 ema which left us in limbo. 
we tried during power hour to gain any momentum to run up and was not able to get any green momentum. we found ourselves selling off heavily right at the end there dropping as low as 466 before we closed. We also have a confirmed daily and weekly sell on the MACD along with a bearish engulfing weekly candle. 

next week i expect a similar fate for us. i expect us to retest the support at the 50 ema which i suspect we will break easily at 464.5. from there we should continue this stair step down towards the final goal/ support at the 100 ema near 455. i suspect it to be closer to 456-457 by time we get there. i do find it rather healthy the way this sell off is happening. instead of wild -2%+ days we are slowly stair stepping down. i like it. 

one thing im watching here is that in general gaps are filled. however if this stair stepping is continued the gap will be below both the 100 ema and the support line. we could see a fast wic down to fill it and a hard bounce. but if that red dotted support line thats over 1.5 years old is broken. we very well could see an even more significant 10%+ from ATH dip. im not convinced thats the market sentiment though yet and will evaluate once there. 

im playing my puts till we break below 460 then i will be looking to sell them and find some longer dated calls. i of course still play the intraday options but for my long term thats my play. 

of course added a picture of my positons to show im not full of it.

4976,wallstreetbets,Nxt-ID Inc. : Lots of Cash &amp; Loaded Chain,"Hello Smoothbrainers, 

I come to you with an interesting opportunity, I’m talking about the stock Nxt-ID. As of writing this, the call chain is stacked:

https://preview.redd.it/4uihv0acmba81.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=825842b0af4dd0cf316c7946068b89825e150833

However, it’s different than others because the company is actually valuable, and not trash and there is a fundamental case for why it’s undervalued at current price. 

Institutions have been loading up, we can see below, and clearly, they like the stock: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u0ax39vfmba81.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5f61e637b870216dcf6e6d70a45954aaa2b7cd

The company has 16m cash on hand, barely any debt, and total assets at about 40m. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8d8fevhmba81.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8103e33bc0f720ce96ecefc14948d43b884484fb

Right now the company could go bankrupt and pay every shareholder $3, which means this is quite almost, risk free.

So I'm digging through a CEO interview on some podcast. Some nice tidbits, the new CEO is first to admit that the company was doing poorly and not run well. They threw the previous ceo under the bus since he was indicted by SEC or something that explains away poor performance for last earnings call. The next earnings call is probably new CEO's first litmus test as that's 3 quarters in on the job. 

**She's ex-amazon and google, and in the interview, she talks about moving from hardware company to software company.** They have new patents for ""fall detection"" so there is expected improvement in device design. They sell ""85% of products into the VA"", **BUT** they were just recently awarded that GSA contract to sell into a ton of new government agencies across United States. She also name drops AARP a lot, so I wouldn't be surprised if there is some partnership there in the works. 

None of this is groundbreaking but builds a great turnaround case and r/r to upside for ""investors"" The GSA contract is the thing that peaks my interest. The award was announced on 12/15, and she was interviewed on 12/7 and dropped hints (maybe slipped?) about the relationship with VA and possible expansion there. Once you're in with the government you're “in” so I expect more contracts soon. Any the institutional loading can see a vote of confidence in Nxt-ID future. 

# Show me the good stuff

So yeah, the chain is loaded and cheap for such a volatile stock. As before the 2.5c have a ton of intrinsic value, and 93 contracts bought today made it jump 1.5%. The 2.5c is going for like .6 rn, so thats like 5k to move a stock 1.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bo3yilkcnba81.gif

Another bullish signal below the surface is which calls are being purchased during the past few weeks. Digging through the flow, on many of the high volume days, the majority of notional is being applied towards contracts with a Delta of .5 or greater. What this means is that, the folks with the bigger wallets are buying ITM/ATM vs. retail who loves to ape into the top strikes, which do nothing to help move price higher.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p8u82u4gnba81.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dc119a3e599516af1b5fd5dfe6ec6de66a0e55e

The above pictured calls are almost all still on the chain as well. It’s been building steadily ever since the GSA contract was announced on 12/15. Go look for yourself.

So aside from the gamma side, on the short interest side, share to borrow have been out for like two months as well:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4l40yp8knba81.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=925b3338f48e0bb9b7ef150d2fdaa6c72d8b5346

And the borrow rate has been skying:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/24n1itklnba81.png?width=1332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98b4c4a843fc567ec250da71becf5f3e7add206

Borrow rate skying, shares gone for over a month, yet price is consolidating? Security lending volume is miniscule as well so basically says the same thing of being out of shares. Seems like shorts are tanking the price to no avail; since its been at the same price point. Right now the company could go bankrupt and pay every share holder $3, so the price is  at a fundamental floor. It’s also at a technical floor because $3 was past resistance. Also the float is low, three different source: Yahoo says [float 6.82m](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NXTD/key-statistics?p=NXTD), Finviz says [float 3.81m](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NXTD), and MarketWatch says [float 4.67m](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nxtd?mod=over_search). Btw on the day Nxt-ID got the GSA contract the price shot up 43% lol, so this can move, also on-balance volume has not recovered since, it’s actually ratcheting up for a grand finale,  so to me that says people are holding, buying, and shares are drying up: \[[defintion: on balance volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp)\]

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/89muyoionba81.png?width=1338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e01aed972ed2a92e0994a9e67cf5782821a723a5

Since the company has so much cash the risk of a dilution is low. This my friends is a tinderbox. Loaded option chain, high SI, institutions accumulating, and the company isn’t trash? Ok, nice. As for any lasting movement, that comes with gamma/short high delta options are the way for the price impact to stick. So I have x243 2.5c. 

Position:

This video is truly fascinating and well put together but I'm wondering if its actually true.

According to this video Latin America is poorer based on the differences in colonization, native population distribution and the continuation of extractive political systems to this day. Is this accurate?

5055,wallstreetbets,The missing link - MOASS imminent!,"SEC Report on whether short sellers closed their positions :   


&gt;During these times, short sellers covering their positions likely contributed to increases in GME’s price. For example, staff observed that particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 the price of GME rose as the short interest decreased. Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which **accounts held by firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period.** Figure 6 shows that buy volume in GME, including buy volume from participants identified as having large short positions, increased significantly beginning around January 22 and remained high for several days, corresponding to the beginning of the most dramatic phase of the run-up in GME’s price.

5066,wallstreetbets,"Let's talk about ROKU, kids.","## Introduction

 I have been pumping ROKU stock for some time. The last time I wrote up some bullish DD was August 2019. The most extensive DD I wrote was Aug 2018 when it was trading at $60/share (I'll link it below). The reasons I like the stock then (very fast growth in users + ARPU) as well as the long-term durability of a business that comes attached to a several hundred dollar device (heavy, not something you move in a whim) still apply. The recent drops make me more bullish on the company than I have ever been. 

## The Company

ROKU is a profitable, fast-growing advertising technology company (like Facebook, Twitter, or Google) that sells television devices as well as software that runs on those devices. Founded in 2002, it is even older than Facebook and Twitter, but didn't IPO until 2017. 

The profitability growth experienced by ROKU since its IPO has been phenomenal -- the vast majority of the stock's performance comes from the performance in its financials, rather than to multiple expansion. ROKU IPO-d at 10x gross profit and now trades at about 20x gross profit -- while gross profit increasing about 7x over the same timeframe. Last quarter, ROKU clocked a 70% YoY increase in gross profit -- the flywheel is still moving at an incalculable rate.

Sales growth has been more modest, remaining in the 50%-60% range but gross profit growth is more reflective of the strength of the business, as ROKU's revenue lumps together one minimally unprofitable + moderate growth business (sales of players) with a highly profitable + fast growing one (sales of targeted ads + other platform fees). 

It's surprising to consider that ROKU is still growing its top line about as quickly as when it IPO-d, but mathematically, this is because small declines in platform growth rate have been offset by the business as a whole increasingly reflecting this faster growing segment. As the platform business is now around 75%-80% of the business, future revenue growth will increasingly reflect platform growth, not player growth. Hence, this shift in mix toward the faster-growing business should continue to act as a tailwind for the company's relative financial performance, even as the growth from this business itself slows over time.

To make a long story short, ROKU's top-line growth is not likely to slow down in the coming years, as both this minor tailwind and minor headwind should be anticipated to roughly offset one another for years to come. Consistent growth at 50%+ for any non-negligible amount of time leads to big numbers, quick.

## Future Performance

ROKU continues to grow extremely quickly, and the stock should continue to benefit from increased revenues &amp; profits, as well as from multiple expansion.

## 10- Year Risk

Warren Buffett likes to ask whether a company in 10 years might have revenues and profits that are not substantially increased from where they are today. In ROKU's case, the risk of this outcome is essentially zero -- even if users stopped growing tomorrow and never resumed, ARPU growth alone could carry the business. As a profitable company, there is no risk to ROKU the company should the capital markets dry up in a big way (though this would of course hurt the stock).

## Competitive Landscape

ROKU reports having the #1 market share in the US &amp; Canada, as well as growing market share in its new international markets -- Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom &amp; France Expansion to new geographies in Europe &amp; Lat/Am is on the immediate horizon. 

ROKU describes its international strategy as ""doing what worked in the US, but in other countries."" Indeed, this does seem to be working.

## The Setup

Back in 2020, ROKU came to be seen as a ""pandemic stock"" -- a company that benefited greatly from one-time factors experienced during the corona pandemic. So for 2021, the comps were tough, and the stock took a hit. The result is a severe market overreaction -- ROKU grew like a weed prior to the pandemic, it grew like a weed during the pandemic, and, it will grow like a weed after the pandemic. The coronavirus affected annual growth rates and profits in a big way, but it did not affect the intrinsic value in a similar way.

The stock is more than 50% off from its highs, even lower than it traded pre-pandemic, while being the strongest company that it has ever been with no signs of stopping.

5068,wallstreetbets,"Leveraged Smart-Beta up another $43K (+$428K, +109% total). Can I get the flair already?","You know the drill. I first showed this [portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/) a year and a half ago, put together a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtmfkk/drydrink_portfolio_guide_to_leveraged_smartbeta/) on it and have provided updates every 4-6 months ([here's the last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0hdra/leveraged_smartbeta_when_is_it_flairworthy_up/ho537ob/?context=3)). I am now up another $43K since then. **TLDR**: here's a portfolio that requires little-to-no trading or time yet leaves boomer index funds way behind; a great default choice for WSB portfolios.

[Performance: Blue line is my portfolio \(up 108.51&amp;#37; since account inception\) while green is SPY \(up \~53&amp;#37;\).](https://preview.redd.it/odz5ed919ba81.png?width=2414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf4e2d363df12171dc2b7515227ab2d1cc1d0bbf)

&amp;#x200B;

[Positions: Nothing particularly noteworthy. Just some smart-beta ETFs and a couple of boomer index funds, all finances with box spreads.](https://preview.redd.it/b7nnpf919ba81.png?width=2934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=644c860d18a7813a9fad7fdda59d30f68010b77b)

International has been a drag but smart-beta has made up for that underperformance almost perfectly so the returns ended up being 2x those of the USA market, which makes sense since I am leveraged 2x.

**More importantly, can anyone tell me how I can get a flair??** I want to be the **Smart-Beta Bitch.** I've been posting about this portfolio for a year and a half (explaining and answering questions), consistently with good returns for everyone to enjoy on their own too. I feel like I deserve a flair at this point.",1641580853

My name is max. I’ve been with you on another account since GME. Bought in at 277€ lost about 80% due to my paperhands. It was the most fun I’ve had with a stock since ever. Still holding one share in good memory. I’m currently working on my bachelor thesis on the psychology of speculations specifically on speculation bubbles in the watch market and could really use your help. I’m trying to give an scientific answer to the question if there actually is an bubble in the current watch market, how big it might be and if and how soon it might burst. In know that this isn’t your regular market but I think at least some of you are also invested there. I would extremely appreciate it if you would take a few minutes to answer my questionnaire. The results of my study will be publicly available and there is no monetary gain for me from this.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.",1641577202

 So tons of division here as Austria opposes nuclear power, alongside countries including Germany and Luxembourg. EU states including the Czech Republic, Finland and France, see nuclear as crucial to phasing out CO2-emitting coal fuel power.

**Kazakhstan:**  
And to top it off, (what odd timing) another thing that may affect the demand/supply equation 

Jan 4, 2022 - State Of Emergency Declared In Kazakhstan's Largest City After Fuel Price Riots, Internet Cut. 

From /r/uraniumsqueeze 

“Political instability is creating a long-term valuation premium for Canadian, Australian uranium”.  The world needs new, reliable supply of uranium and reserves in Canada, Australia, USA became much more attractive, (Eg. DNN and NXE in Saskatchewan just received a geopolitical valuation premium they will keep for years.)”.

**Some good people to follow for uranium info:**

Twitter:  
u/quakes99 \- John Quakes (retired earth sciences researcher)  
u/uraniuminsider  

Reddit:  
/r/uraniumsqueeze 

Some of the largest uranium producers in the world: ccj (cameco), rio (rio tinto), bhp 

Some related ETFs that tracks a bunch of uranium related companies, mining, production of nuclear components, extraction, refining etc 

* URA: The Global X Uranium ETF (the largest ETF in uranium space wrt market cap and liquidity) 
* HURA (Horizon Global Uranium Index ETF)

Sprott physical uranium trust (SPUT) ticker U.UN

Sprott uranium miner etf  (URNM)

So my simple understanding is that companies are less incentivized to mine for uranium as it’s not viable once the prices are low.. but eventually the supply becomes too low since it’s been chronically undermined (or whatever other additional reasons like oil price being high causing an increase in demand?) that it causes the uranium price to go up because demand exceeds supply, and then once uranium prices go up, companies are now incentivized to mine for uranium.  So that along with the current political / global macro landscape, I personally have decided to make my play with pre-discovery uranium exploration companies that have a high probability of an impactful uranium discovery during a hot uranium market. That seems like a good way to make money???

Main play I went with is Azincourt Energy (Aaz, TSVX, Azurf, OTC).   And less so, Cat strategic metals ([cat.cn](http://cat.cn/) on cse).  Azincourt:They are planning on drilling 30-35 holes and do 6000m, and they should be starting the drilling some time this week or early next week. They will do it for all of Jan, Feb and into early March.

5172,wallstreetbets,"Why I am bullish for Uranium and Nuclear, right now part 1","**Sprotts bullish about Uranium:**

Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets.

On November 4, Sprott Asset Management had a PR that they are taking over the Northeshore  ETF for uranium miners.  (URNM).

“URNM is the only US-listed pure-play uranium equities ETF and is a complement to Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) which is the worlds largest physical uranium fund.” 

Once Sprott took over this physical uranium trust-  Sprott Physical Uranium Trust “SPUT” (U.UN) on the Toronto Exchange earlier this year, that trust has secured 23 million lbs of uranium.  They secured it into a warehouse and won’t be released in a few years, they plan on stacking uranium.   This physical uranium trust already had some from before Sprott taking over, the total they have now is 41 million lbs. 

Sprott is a key driver for this market. 

Sprott expects a NYSE listing of their physical uranium trust (SPUT) by the first half 2022. The Northshore Mining Index URNM should also be taken over by Sprott in the next 60 days.  Since inception of the trust, Sprott purchased 23 million lb of uranium between July to the end of 2021.

So the US passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill which includes the above funding.   The “build back better” package in its current form got shut down by Joe Manchin.  Since this man has the entire dem party by the balls and Biden will need some compromise of this bill passed next year as a legislative win for the 2022 midterms, Manchin has the upper hand here, hes pro-nuclear, if something gets cut off, it likely won’t be the additional funding that “Build Back Better aka the house-passed reconciliation bill” provided towards nuclear such as:

So something passing early 2022 could be further bullish for nuclear energy / uranium.

In what world was he wrong? Gamestop ruined this place for the first half of 2021 after the squeeze. It was a complete DUMPSTER FIRE until people stopped forcing a new squeeze or discussing gamestop every fucking minute. 

Look at the front page. They have 3 separate communities, one with 720k users where they promote their pump and dump every day. Why tcan't they post there? Isn't everyone a shill out to stop their $500 cOmPuteRsHarE-registered stocks from reaching 50 quadrillion billion trillion? 

Every place nowadays is infested with GME/AMC apes. They're a cancer that plagues every community by dumbasses who are made at the fact their pump and dump is losing momentum and almost 80% of all their shares are in the red.

Yes, mods shouldn't choose what should and shouldn't be discussed, but there needs to be exceptions if we want WSB to not become a dumpster fire again. They called this place a shillfest for several months; why do they want to come here anyway?

For all the shit talking they do, I think it's fair if GME/AMC talk was banned unless it breaks its ATH. They talked so much shit for a weak pump that's barely lasting **ninety** minutes into the day.

They \[SHF+MM's\] have been running away from the Calls on the Options Chain for the past month, tanking the price with everything they could with the plan to hold it beneath the majority of the Calls throughout December and January (where Apes had options purchased expecting a run from the FTD cycles).

They clearly were willing to burn their ETF source to the ground to get it there, but they didn't care - it was game over if those options started requiring hedging &amp; price runs into gamma ramps started.

Survive. One more month. One more week. One more day. That's what they've been doing this entire year.

FOMO into shares by retail is easily handled. Retail doesn't move the price by buying. Lots under 100 don't affect anything. Lots that come in in bunches of 100 can be split up and processed by the MM to avoid price movement.

Options chain purchases however, do move the price.

FOMO into Options, like we started to see in the degenerate sub, would be their ruin. So, the play is to jank the price &amp; spike IV. Make the options that hurt (further dated calls - Feb and out) them expensive AF.

Absolute desperation stakes now. You think that other sub &amp; degen retail give that much of a shit if Calls are more expensive, *if* they think there's massive profit to be had from a squeeze?

Institutions, like JP Morgan, already piled in with shares AND options - and directly signaled a squeeze in an MSM article.

We have major banks and Prime Lenders shedding all their puts &amp; loading up on calls and shares.

5231,wallstreetbets,"My Market Analysis - Unemployment 3.9% (4.1% expected), New hires down, Wage increases &gt; expected. Recent NASDAQ drop - Federal Reserve minutes. Federal Reserve Jan 25,26 Inflation Jan 12","**Happy New Year everyone!! :)**

The US today released 4 sets of important data (from Trading Economics).

https://preview.redd.it/jvcs6g9d8aa81.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7e32f56dc7a3013af3900183fe260e191f6823

Unemployment was better than expected (3.9%) vs 4.1% expected. During the day the the Federal Reserve Minutes was released, NASDAQ dropped a whopping 3.3% or so. This was because the Federal Reserve said they might even consider a March rate hike.

With Omicron seemingly less problematic - UK still being cautious but relatively accomodative, Australia did reinstate some restrictions (no nightclubs, no signing, dancing etc), but most countries seem to understand Omicron is less virulent, except it can cause hospitalisations to increase dramatically.

The US's situation might be slightly differently, since comorbidities and other high rates of pre-existing conditions can amplify death rates.

With this in mind, the Federal Reserve last month I predicted will take a cautious approach to Omicron ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgx1qg/federal\_reserve\_day\_my\_predictions\_on\_powells/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgx1qg/federal_reserve_day_my_predictions_on_powells/)). However, with Omicron not causing ""too much"" (too much can be relative, but relative to say Delta), trouble, the **Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum unemployment will be changed - ie they will now care more about inflation, and less on unemployment.**

The data shows it - unemployment decreased below expectations (3.9%) vs 4.1%. This further shows maximum unemployment is NOT an issue now (meaning the Fed will concentrate on inflation).

However, fascinatingly, other measures are more better for markets - Nonfarm payrolls (new jobs) was LOWER than expected - ie less new hiring. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/december-2021-jobs-report-labor-department-unemployment-usa-192453058.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/december-2021-jobs-report-labor-department-unemployment-usa-192453058.html) shows a slowdown in hiring (200K hires vs 400K expected).

The participation rate did not budge a lot - it's stuck at 61.9%. Companies have increased wages more than expected 0.6% vs 0.4% since last month. This means companies have increased wages.

However therein lies the problem for the Fed - Participation rate is very slowly increasing. It's staggeringly low at 61.9% (lowest since 1976 ish). More wages, but less new jobs - this could indicate companies are hiring yes - but looking at an existing pool of workers. With unemployment down more than expected - this means the workforce is stretched to ""maximum usage"".

**However expert are saying Omicron will rather cause unemployment to rise in January - which will be released in February - this is very possible** but seems unlikely - since Omicron hasn't cause mass lockdowns yet. Work from home is seen though.

This means the Fed will concentrate more on inflation now, and less on employment - which means the January 12 Inflation data is key. Likewise the Federal Reserve meeting January 25-26 is very important. Concensus for inflation is 7.1% this month - I'll have to do more analysis on my predictions for inflation ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rd8hu3/inflation\_countdown\_10\_minutes\_830\_et\_my\_guess](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rd8hu3/inflation_countdown_10_minutes_830_et_my_guess) last time predicted 6.7 to 6.9% actual 6.8%)

With this in mind - markets in the morning were positive - most likely due to good unemployment data. However, it soured somewhat as people remembered actually - worse than expected is better - since it will force the Fed to not raise rates earlier.",1641571024

5239,wallstreetbets,"A hypothesis on why labor market induced inflationary pressure is not going to last, and why tech will win","New jobs added keeps missing meanwhile wages go up. The labor market is tight. By now, everyone has heard of the ""big quit"", the phenomenon in which massive numbers of workforce participants seem to have decided to quit their jobs to pursue better opportunities at around the same time. The tightness in the labor market is probably one of the largest driving factors of inflation that are affecting everything from commodity pricing to supply chain bottlenecks.  

What caused this? My guess is that this stems from the fact that every retard and his wife's boyfriend out there has been drooling (for a while) over some combination of influencers, professional gamers, or youtube moneyman gurus they've put on a pedestal as their dream to escape their personal work hell of appeasing customers or moving a box from one location to the next 8 hours a day for no appreciation and shit pay. After all, if they can do it and give you the elementary school tier advice to follow your heart and be what you want to be, why shouldn't you? Well, for most of the tards out there, this comes down to personal risk tolerance as a reason for not doing so. Turns out being stuck in some dystopian situation where they are redlining their finances every month and cannot (or are otherwise too afraid to) take any sort of risky leap that would put their steady supply of basic necessities at risk is generally a no go.

So what has changed? Firstly, the shutdown effects in 2020 gave a decent number of people a taste of what life could be like outside the hamster wheel of physically commuting to work and servicing their corporate overlords for a daily helping of company cheese. Secondly, the government gave people who were previously living month to month free money, which many of them may have actually used to build up ""savings"". As time goes on, these people started really thinking about what they've just seen go down. They're watching people get rich on the big stonk rip, the big shitcoin boom, and after hundreds of hours of youtube they're increasingly convinced they can also succeed by jumping into whatever is pumping, despite not having a firm grasp on the base truth of what it is they are actually doing. As the friction at work increases with a steady stream of pain-in-the-ass covid-induced problems, a small number on the bolder side of the spectrum start to have a thought: ""wait I have money to live for a bit, I don't need to put up with this"". The internet magic money people have convinced them, and now they can afford to take the leap. So they do.  

Next comes the snowball: this effect intensifies after the trendsetters put things into motion, and companies need to hire to keep the cheddar flowing. However, there is now an imbalance in labor supply and demand; they need to up the pay ante. This creates another snowball effect...people who do want to keep working see other places paying more for what they perceive to be an easy job. After all, if the 8 year old minecraft streamer and his mom and her boyfriend get to make 7 figures, why would they want to keep killing themselves for a fraction of that when they could at least do it under cushier circumstances? This is where everything starts going down the drain, at least short-term.  

Why short-term, you ask? If you  stop to think about it, these people who are quitting these positions cannot possibly have that much saved up. They may be lowering their expenditures to stretch it, and that may cause it to last a bit longer, but we are talking months at most in many scenarios. The fundamental imbalance still remains. And the same supply and demand forces that drive every market will also be present in what I will cordially refer to as the ""retard internet economy"". Every ape and his 3 roommates becoming a streamer on onlyfans and starting their own stock analysis youtube while wendy's tries to hire for $50 dollars an hour is not going to be a permanent equilibrium. Most of these people will run out of savings very soon, and there will be a massive reflexive inflow back into the job market so that they don't go homeless, creating a deflationary pressure on labor, lower pay, and lower sustained purchasing power through the broader economy.

So all is going back to normal now, right? Wrong. The big corps, who previously acted complacent with a mentally lazy ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" attitude may breathe a sigh of relief when they finally stop hemorrhaging money to hire for simple roles, but now that they've seen their own blood once, you can bet your ass the CEOs will be up in the board room on a saturday night smoking a cigarette figuring out how to take care of this liability for good. In short: I predict a big rubber band snap back to an employers market for labor, followed by a continuing sustained deflationary pressure as there is a renewed fire under corporations' ass to permanently replace as many people as possible or otherwise heavily augment the productivity of the people they do require.  

In conclusion: I think this year might mostly suck with the chaos in the markets, but I think Cathie is going to end up being right. It is just a matter of when rather than if in my view, and as the wage pressures continue to reveal themselves as the primary problem, the process will likely be accelerated and cause a lasting rotation into innovation / AI / automation tech.  

Disclaimer: am very caffeinated and running on low sleep, but the jobs report today inspired this post. Do your own research, I could be wrong and maybe the future is investing in NFTs of different kinds of potato based pixel art while streaming minecraft so that you can pay $200 for a chicken sandwich.

I had set my conservative unleveraged price target at $36, but B of A has upgraded to a BUY with a $45 target raising the consensus estimate to $40.

I started trading 2 months ago and used trade republic platform (its popular in Germany).","During this time I managed to be 30% down in ENPH, 20% down in BNTX and around 10% down in 2 ETFs I chose. Some other positions are going better. My initial selection was based on criteria like: I know the company, I believe in the sector development etc (non technical analysis related). I know by now that was a mistake. And I kind of learned by it but I guess it takes time. I read a lot that you need to have a stop loss strategy. What would be a good one or where can I read about it? I think this is important for my first steps in trading. Also I am still holding the above positions but I am very uncertain if that’s a good idea. Any advice is fully appreciated!!!",1641567809

The company was running out of money and they took a desperate step - an additional issue, so that there would be enough money until the completion of the research, but the funds understand this and began to open short positions even more, diluting the already meager capital of the company.

5397,wallstreetbets,"Let me know your thoughts on $MVST, its an undercovered EV powerplay with only one analyst coverage.","While the MVST stock has been on a rapid decline over the past week, a deeper dive into its underlying business would indicate that it is incredibly undervalued right now. The company has been developing cutting-edge battery technology for commercial and passenger vehicles for more than 15 years, and has recently made its debut on Nasdaq after completing a reverse SPAC merger with Tuscan Holdings in July 2021.

MVST has already established a global presence across China, the U.S. and Europe with more than 30,000 commercial vehicles across 19 countries now running on its batteries. The company had received net cash proceeds of more than $820 million following its merger with Tuscan Holdings, in which it plans to deploy towards its ongoing expansion projects. They include the construction of a new world-class battery manufacturing facility in Clarksville, Tennessee; expansion of its manufacturing plant in Huzhou, China; and operations at its new modular battery pack production plant in Berlin. Together, the company has potential for close to 30 gWh of annual battery production capacity coming online by 2025. 

Rapid EV adoption is expected to account for more than 400 gWh of battery demand by 2025. With projections for declining battery prices to $100/kWh in coming years, a quick back-of-the-napkin calculation would show that MVST has ability capitalize on at least 5% of global market share and generate annual revenues of $2.6 billion by mid-decade. The company already has a massive orderbook valued at more than $2.3 billion and growing. Key customers include reputable OEMs like Oshkosh, eVersum and SAFRA. MVST also boasts a strong balance sheet, with a net cash position of close to $480 million as of 2021’s third quarter-end. The company also has an implied cash runway of four to five years based on cash use observed over YTD Q3, which supports its ability to further invest in growth in coming years.

MVST also has a large trove of more than 550 patents/patent applications for proprietary next-generation battery technologies that it intends to license out in the future. This would secure a steady recurring stream of high-margin royalty revenues for the business. The market for this will be tremendous in coming years as fierce competition in the EV races fosters demand for market leading battery competencies.",1641560058

We live in a world where messages flow at the speed of light, but medical records might take days to arrive. The absence of a single system for the accurate and safe sharing of medical information eventually causes faults and delays in treatment operations. Humanity needs to be saved from the mass doom. It seems to me like we live in the time of great technologies which can simplify not only the purchasing of something,deliveries,  transportation, communication, even earnings, but also treatment…   
Decentralization and blockchain adaptation also is one of the real methods. Most countries already have systems based on DeHealth and artificial intelligence. With decentralization in the healthcare system we can fight a lot of problems. Patients will have control over their medical personal data, and it won’t be vulnerable for hackers attacks on a daily basis. Every person would have a possibility to get a consultation on the go just with his phone. No more queues and bribes to the doctors who think that they are not paid enough to cure… What? Not enough paid to cure, what nonsense you might think. But don’t be surprised because in poor countries it is not a myth, it is reality.

Okay, most of us, me – not. I am just in love with their marketers:) Their product isn’t as worthy as it is paid for. You can say I am dude, okay, no cap.   
I just wanted to ask if you heard anything about Magic Square and their investigations? truly saying, i hope they will dive into the market soon. I can’t wait to see what they have prepared for us. In few words what actually it is..  
Magic Square created a unique model for the Magic Store. Users can earn rewards just for downloading and using apps. Each day Magic Square will distribute rewards based on the personal ranking of the user, their “Karma Score"". This unique model allows users to earn SQR  tokens without investing their money, just their time. Users with the highest monthly score will get additional rewards as special NFTs. That’s kinda a decentralized App Store and Play Market.    
The App and Play stores are managed by Apple and Google teams, respectively. As the stores became more popular, the teams got bigger and bigger to provide the same level of service to the app developers. Magic Square wants to engage the community’s power to control the quality of deapps that will be listed in the Magic Store.  
So what’s your opinion on this? I subscribed to their beta at the Q1 of/22. Just seems to be promising, I have to check it out on my own.",1641548544

5522,wallstreetbets,Last night and this morning: Nasdaq drops three straight! Chinese stocks staged a general surge----For sharing,"**Abstract:**

* **The prospect of the Federal Reserve to accelerate the tightening of monetary policy put pressure on stock indexes, a Federal Reserve official said the Fed may raise interest rates as early as March and then shrink;**
* **Gold futures fell below the $1,800 mark as interest rate hikes pushed up Treasury yields;**
* **Popular Chinese stocks closed mostly higher on Thursday, shell over 10%, fog core technology rose over 8%.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Overseas Markets**

1. Dow closes down 170 points, Nasdaq slides for third straight day

U.S. stocks closed lower on Thursday, with the Dow closing down 170 points and the Nasdaq recording its third consecutive session of declines. The prospect of the Federal Reserve accelerating the tightening of monetary policy put pressure on the stock index. A Federal Reserve official said the Fed may raise interest rates as early as March and then taper. U.S. initial jobless claims rose by 207,000 last week, exceeding expectations.

The Dow fell 0.47%, the Nasdaq fell 0.13% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.10%.

The energy sector was generally higher. Crude oil prices climbed, pushing shares of Marathon Oil, Occidental Petroleum and Exxon Mobil higher, while Tesla shares continued to move lower.

2. Most of the popular Chinese stocks closed higher on Thursday Shell rose more than 10%

Most of the popular Chinese stocks closed higher on Thursday, shells, fog core technology and other gains; shells rose more than 10%, fog core technology rose more than 8%, Jingdong rose nearly 6%, new energy auto stocks, Peng car rose more than 1%, ideal car fell more than 2%, Azera car fell nearly 2%.

3. The main index of European shares fell

Britain's FTSE 100 index fell 0.92%, France's CAC 40 index fell 1.72%, the European Stoxx 50 index fell 1.57%.

4. U.S. oil rose .1% on Thursday, the highest close in 7 weeks

Crude oil futures recorded their fourth straight session of gains on Thursday and their highest close in seven weeks, extending a strong start to 2022. Oil prices were boosted by riots in Kazakhstan and crude oil production disruptions in Libya, among others.

Commerzbank commodities analyst Barbara Lambrecht pointed out that Kazakhstan is currently producing 1.6 million barrels of oil per day, and the unrest has now spread to the center of the country's western oil cities.

5. Gold futures fell 2% on Thursday lost the $1,800 mark

Inflation usually helps gold prices rise, but the prospect of an interest rate hike reduces the investment appeal of gold because it pushes up Treasury yields, thus reducing investor interest in assets such as gold that do not offer a fixed rate of return.

Gold futures for February delivery fell $35.90, or 2 percent, to close at $1,789.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures price closed 0.6 percent higher on Wednesday.

6. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield once exceeded 1.75%, approaching the 2021 high

U.S. Treasury yields climbed this week as the Federal Reserve will increase monetary tightening to curb inflation. Interest rate futures markets expect the Fed may raise interest rates for the first time in March, and minutes of the latest meeting released Wednesday showed Fed officials plan to shrink the size of their balance sheet faster than before. A surge in new corporate bond issuance also put pressure on the market this week.

Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at UBS's securities unit, said, ""There were a lot of trading strategies that suffered setbacks last year, such as shorting real rates and going long the peak federal funds rate, and they looked a little extreme from a valuation perspective, and the new year has provided a fresh start to risk budgets and people are coming back to those trades "".

**International Macro**

1. Federal Reserve official Bullard: may raise rates as early as March and then taper to curb inflation

""Asset purchases will end in the next few months, but the Federal Open Market Committee may also choose to let the balance sheet contract passively so as to reduce monetary accommodation at an appropriate pace,"" Bullard said, adding that shrinking the balance sheet ""could be the next step ""One of the next steps.

He said the Federal Open Market Committee is dealing with ""inflationary shocks. Price increases reached the highest level in decades, much higher than policymakers expected a year ago.

2. Revised financial documents show that Clarida sold and bought back equity funds before the Fed promised to rescue the market

The new tables show Clarida sold between $1 million and $5 million of the iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor exchange-traded fund on Feb. 24, 2020, then bought a similar size of that fund on Feb. 27.

The disclosure may add to the suspicion that the outgoing vice chairman knew or anticipated the content of the announcement to be made by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Feb. 28. In this announcement, Powell said the Fed is prepared to take aggressive action to cushion the impact of the epidemic on the economy and financial markets.

3. The U.S. trade deficit widened in November imports increased to record levels

The U.S. trade deficit widened in November, reflecting a surge in imports as retailers make final preparations for the holiday season and increased U.S. demand for overseas oil.

The goods and services trade deficit widened to $80.2 billion from a revised $67.2 billion in October, according to U.S. Commerce Department data released Thursday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was a deficit of $81 billion. The data was not adjusted for price factors.

4. WHO: Global new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia rose sharply by 71% last week

The report noted that new confirmed cases increased in all regions, with the largest increase in the Americas region, up 100% from the previous week, followed by the Southeast Asia region and the European region, with increases of 78% and 65%, respectively. The European region continues to have the highest incidence, with the five countries that reported the most cases last week being the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy.

5. The U.S. services index in December hit the largest decline of more than a year and a half, weaker than all economists expected

Anthony Nieves, chairman of the ISM Services Survey Committee, said, ""While most indices saw a pullback in December, services growth remained strong, and surveyed companies said they continue to face inflation, supply chain disruptions, capacity constraints, logistics challenges, and labor and material shortages.""

6. U.S. initial jobless claims rose to 207,000 last week

U.S. jobless claims rose last week, but remained near record lows as the labor market weathered the latest wave of the new crown epidemic.

While first-time jobless claims rose, they have remained near fifty-year lows in recent weeks as companies struggle to maintain their current workforce amid a widespread situation of labor supply shortages and employee resignations. However, the widespread spread of the omicron mutant strain has reignited economic concerns.

7. U.S. mortgage rates soar to 3.22%, highest level since May 2020

Freddie Mac said in a statement Thursday that 30-year mortgage rates averaged 3.22 percent, up from 3.11 percent last week and the highest level since late May 2020.

""With rising inflation, a positive economic growth outlook and tight labor market supply, we expect rates to continue to rise,"" Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater said. ""So far, rising interest rates have continued to have little impact on demand for home purchases.""

8. The U.S. and Russia ""talks week"" before the exchange of harsh words, Russian media: dialogue does not guarantee that relations between the two countries will not further deteriorate

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow will take a ""rather tough"" attitude in the talks, ""and there will be no other attitude than this, because we are trying to 'convince' the other side that the dialogue has gone on too long,"" Russian newspaper ""Kommersant"" reported on June 6. The dialogue with the other side has gone on for too long"". Ryabkov stressed that Russia does not take a ""no-everything"" position, but tries to find a solution based on a balance of interests.

Against the backdrop of the intensifying Russia-Ukraine crisis, Russia submitted a draft security initiative to the West in December last year, asking NATO to commit to no further eastward expansion and no deployment of weapons in Ukraine. To ease tensions between Russia and the West as well as Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. will hold strategic dialogue talks at the diplomatic level on January 10, Russia and NATO will hold security talks on January 12, and Russia and the OSCE will hold a multi-party meeting on January 13.

9. Germany 2021 annual inflation rate of 3.1%, the highest level in history since 1993

The continued rise in inflation has also led to a decline in the purchasing power of German consumers, with economists saying that poorer households are particularly affected, having to incur more spending for housing and necessities. The Federal Ministry of Construction is seeking to provide more subsidies for low-income people on housing benefits, and rising inflation is also hitting savings, which have lost all their appeal with low interest rates. At the same time, the German government will also face billions of euros in losses as it needs to pay higher costs for infrastructure such as roads and buildings.

**Company news**

1. The world's largest uranium producer: the company is running normally and is not affected by the situation in Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan's State Atomic Energy Industry Corporation (Kazatomprom), the world's largest uranium producer, said that despite the unrest in Kazakhstan, the company is operating normally and its production or exports have not been affected.

3. Uber to close Brazilian delivery business, operating until March 7

Uber has decided to terminate its takeaway business in Brazil, Uber Eats, and said the company's takeaway service Uber Eats will operate in Brazil until March 7, according to a report in Brazilian daily newspaper on Thursday.

4. Questioned again! India expresses concern over safety of Mercer's new crown drug

The head of India's leading medical research institute said on Wednesday that Mercer's new oral crown drug molnupiravir has ""significant safety issues"" that may prevent it from joining the country's list of viral treatments.

The oral drug, molnupiravir, is said to ultimately stop the replication of the virus by introducing a different mechanism in the genetic material, but it could affect growing human cells.

Now that that is outta the way... what if we did see a 20% correction? from the ATH that 20% dip would put us at 384. which would put us right back into the channel that SPY traded in for over 7 years from 2013 to 2020 when we saw the market absolutely tank and break that channel. followed by billions of dollars being pumped by the fed to cause us to shoot skyward and then start the current trend we are on...  weekly 100 day EMA is 394... 

white lines show the 7 year long channel. red/ blue show the current channel thats been almost 2 years long. what if we did tank? what if we did see a reset and this fell all the way back into the channel and then continued on in that channel? 

if you follow me you will know i believe we are going to see 455. but if that 455 breaks down that would break the 1.5 year long channel. would that be the sign?

what's your thoughts? With the fed already telling us they are gonna increase interest rates, inflation running wild, covid spreading like wild fire, unemployment terrible, economy terrible, etc. Etc.

5666,wallstreetbets,$FRHC: Retarded Learnings of Political Unrest for Make Profit Off Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"G’day guys and gals. I’m proud to announce that finally have something to contribute to this beautiful community.

Preface: I am new to securities, stocks, currencies, and everything else, and therefore no one should listen to me or anything I say. However, I am interested in central Asian and Eastern European affairs and investments (looking at you, $VEON). Anyway, looking into the news lately, things have gotten a little spicy in the home of beloved television journalist, Borat Margaret Sagdiyev: the glorious #1 exporter of Potassium, Kazakhstan 🇰🇿.

Part One: What’s Going On With Kazakhstan?

For those of you who don’t know, Kazakhstan is currently being soft invaded by a Russian-led coalition of former Soviet states in order to quell politically motivated violence and kill a possible coup against the long running Russian backed autocracy that has run Kazakhstan since the collapse of the Soviet Union. So far police, soldiers and civilians have been killed in Almaty, the country’s capital and largest city. Internet has been suspended. Government buildings have been set aflame, or occupied, and even the international airport has been looted.

From this article I pulled randomly off the internet, called “Kazakhstan is in chaos. Here’s why the West should be watching.”

“Kazakhstan has been a largely stable autocracy since the collapse of the Soviet Union; protests of this scale haven’t been seen since the 1980s. Kazakhstan is, however, surprisingly important to the economies of states in Europe and—to a lesser extent—Asia, as that political stability has enabled it to become a major exporter of oil, natural gas, and coal. Kazakhstan is also an important energy transit country for its neighboring resource-rich Central Asian states. The protests have already reached workers at the Tengiz oil field, though production has not yet been affected. If these protests become significant enough to disrupt energy production or transit, they could have knock-on economic effects disproportionate to Kazakhstan’s political importance.”

What I am getting from all this is: 

1. Kazakhstan is a longtime stable country with a relatively strong economy (thanks autocracy) that plays into the larger workings of Europe and Asia. Ergo foreign and domestic cash may has seen Kazakh investments as a safeish bet.

2. With the recent upheavals going on, no one knows where the dice will land. Old money is scared money, and I’m thinking that if a few oligarchs started to get a little antsy in the pantsy about certain autocratically-assured investments literally going up in flames along with the current regime, then a large sell off might be imminent.

Part Two: How Can I Profit From This?

As I just said, I’m not very good at investing, as I’m quite new. Thus I have zero TA skills or ability to do any kind of proper DD. I’m sorry. I’m just not there yet. However, I do have Robinhood as one of three brokerages, the others being Fidelity and ComputerShare (please God, let GM E moon before I have to pay these taxes back). The neat thing about Robinhood is that:

1. They let you search tickets by country, and 
2. Their simple crayon-colored UI allows idiots like me to easily see what’s high and low price-wise so as to inform my  doomed YOLOs.

Using this patent-pending method, if you search Kazakhstani tickets in Robinhood, only two companies come up. They are:

Ox.us Acquisition -  a Kazakhstan-based company that is a blank check company. The Company was created to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 

And

Freedom Holding ($FRHC) - Freedom Holding Corp., through its subsidiaries, provides retail securities brokerage, research, investment counseling, securities trading, market making, corporate investment banking, and underwriting services. Headquartered in Almaty City, Kazakhstan.

Now, of these two arbitrarily-selected securities, only $FRHC has options trading a la Robinhood, albeit only through June 2022. According to the app’s chart, $FRHC has been on a perma bull run since it’s listing in 2019 at $13.95 per share. Since then the price has continued to grow at almost 100% YOY, up to its current price of $68.30 per share. Not only that, but since the news of the deadly riots started this week, the stock has largely flatlined, and is down just 2%….

So,  I just bought a new phone. When I  installed whatsapp, it automatically  started restoring a media backup  from my Google drive.

Looking  to  clean things up, I just found 12000 pictures on my phone of which  over  half are RANDOM PEOPLE's personal photos. I'm talking photos of  IDs,  selfies, graduations, baby pics, family photos, screenshots and all   sorts of other sensitive data.

A   pattern I've seen is that the people are from my local area, there are   multiple if not dozens of different families and people's photos mixed   in there.

Something serious happened here. Someone seriously fucked up on META's side or Google.

My question is what the hell do I do about it. This seems like a serious breach or malfunction in the encryption software.

Moreover, if this happened to these people, there's odds my things ended up on other's people's phones. Fuck.",1641530224

5692,wallstreetbets,$FRHC: Retarded Learnings for Make Profit Off Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"G’day guys and gals. I’m proud to announce that finally have something to contribute to this beautiful community.

Preface: I am new to securities, stocks, currencies, and everything else, and therefore no one should listen to me or anything I say. However, I am interested in central Asian and Eastern European affairs and investments (looking at you, $VEON). Anyway, looking into the news lately, things have gotten a little spicy in the home of beloved television journalist, Borat Margaret Sagdiyev: the glorious #1 exporter of Potassium, Kazakhstan 🇰🇿.

Part One: What’s Going On With Kazakhstan?

For those of you who don’t know, Kazakhstan is currently being soft invaded by a Russian-led coalition of former Soviet states in order to quell politically motivated violence and kill a possible coup against the long running Russian backed autocracy that has run Kazakhstan since the collapse of the Soviet Union. So far police, soldiers and civilians have been killed in Almaty, the country’s capital and largest city. Internet has been suspended. Government buildings have been set aflame, or occupied, and even the international airport has been looted.

From this article I pulled randomly off the internet, called “Kazakhstan is in chaos. Here’s why the West should be watching.”

“Kazakhstan has been a largely stable autocracy since the collapse of the Soviet Union; protests of this scale haven’t been seen since the 1980s. Kazakhstan is, however, surprisingly important to the economies of states in Europe and—to a lesser extent—Asia, as that political stability has enabled it to become a major exporter of oil, natural gas, and coal. Kazakhstan is also an important energy transit country for its neighboring resource-rich Central Asian states. The protests have already reached workers at the Tengiz oil field, though production has not yet been affected. If these protests become significant enough to disrupt energy production or transit, they could have knock-on economic effects disproportionate to Kazakhstan’s political importance.”

What I am getting from all this is: 

1. Kazakhstan is a longtime stable country with a relatively strong economy (thanks autocracy) that plays into the larger workings of Europe and Asia. Ergo foreign and domestic cash may has seen Kazakh investments as a safeish bet.

2. With the recent upheavals going on, no one knows where the dice will land. Old money is scared money, and I’m thinking that if a few oligarchs started to get a little antsy in the pantsy about certain autocratically-assured investments literally going up in flames along with the current regime, then a large sell off might be imminent.

Part Two: How Can I Profit From This?

As I just said, I’m not very good at investing, as I’m quite new. Thus I have zero TA skills or ability to do any kind of proper DD. I’m sorry. I’m just not there yet. However, I do have Robinhood as one of three brokerages, the others being Fidelity and ComputerShare (please God, let GM E moon before I have to pay these taxes back). The neat thing about Robinhood is that:

1. They let you search tickets by country, and 
2. Their simple crayon-colored UI allows idiots like me to easily see what’s high and low price-wise so as to inform my  doomed YOLOs.

Using this patent-pending method, if you search Kazakhstani tickets in Robinhood, only two companies come up. They are:

Oxus Acquisition ($OXUS) -  a Kazakhstan-based company that is a blank check company. The Company was created to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 

And

Freedom Holding ($FRHC) - Freedom Holding Corp., through its subsidiaries, provides retail securities brokerage, research, investment counseling, securities trading, market making, corporate investment banking, and underwriting services. Headquartered in Almaty City, Kazakhstan.

Now, of these two arbitrarily-selected securities, only $FRHC has options trading a la Robinhood, albeit only through June 2022. According to the app’s chart, $FRHC has been on a perma bull run since it’s listing in 2019 at $13.95 per share. Since then the price has continued to grow at almost 100% YOY, up to its current price of $68.30 per share. Not only that, but since the news of the deadly riots started this week, the stock has largely flatlined, and is down just 2%….

Do you see what I’m seeing?

Part Three: Conclusions

Now, I’m very, very far from being a genius. But this one seems like a no brainer. My thesis is that political instability in Kazakhstan will cause Kazakh tickers to fall. Freedom Holdings, sitting at a juicy inflated 389% up since 2019 is a Kazakh company that is perhaps particularly due for a fall. I.e. buy puts now, ask questions later.

So I personally don’t get where Wall Street analysts are getting their data from ? That gym memberships are going up and home fitness was a pandemic anomaly! I just don’t buy it - I think personally there is space for both to be honest, and 2 years is a pretty long time to form a lasting habit and it’s hard to go back to a gym! Just want to hear some thoughts on your own experience and hoping to use that data to take a shot at peloton stock! 

I don’t feel sorry for them, because they have made one too many mistakes and are paying the price, but at the same time they are also an industry leader and have a strong brand presence and could bounce back big if the home fitness is here to stay for the longer term!

Couple things to clarify, this is not a hype post, or a conspiracy post etc, but this is to explain why the ""GME too $1000.00, is not a meme"" was actually never a meme.

A lot of people probably hear this and think man how is that possible or no way that will ever happen etc.

People will hear others talk about DRS shares and scoff at it like it's a ridiculous thing.

Couple things I want to explain quickly. 

First, go Google ""Biggest short squeezes"" or something along those lines and you will find the history.

Some super recent and some that are older. Below are some examples:

https://preview.redd.it/dpfvc6wic6a81.jpg?width=1238&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f55d0342438031fc2c8b69bc32c4af914d1fec54

And there's many more.

All of these massive squeezes all had the following situations occur:

\- WallStreet Hedge Fund decided to short the shit out of the stock with the hopes to bankrupt the companies.

\- The CEO's of the companies and investors bought up all of the shares and acquired ownership of the float. (DRS) (Shorts could never truly cover, the debt just keeps accruing)

\- Some of the CEO's cornered the short sellers who had to then bail on their positions by settling with the CEO's in court. (They lost a shit load). Some just plain squeezed and the shorts got recked. 

\- Ackman who shorted Herbalife, continued to short the stock for 6 years and then had to settle in the courts to get out of his positions and lost approximately $1 Billion. (GME shorts have accumulated well over this figure).

\- By acquiring the shares, holding, and taking the shares out of the market through (Full ownership, float being bought up by the company and retail, and DRS). They literally demanded the price.

\- ""GME to $1000"" what are these quacks talking about right? Well just one example, VW when it squeezed at its peak, it went from $124.00 to $1000.00. The comparison in circumstances and situations from VW and GME are vastly different in the sense of comparing the shear amount of unrealized losses the shorts have accumulated in GME. But this is just to give a small perspective that yes, a setup like that really does go full moon retard.

\- Not all, but some of the companies turned around and became successful and completely went the opposite direction that the short sellers wanted.

If you actually read let's say, the top 10 short squeezes from whatever blogger or financial publications, you will see a lot of similarities.

Always either shorts intending to purposefully short and destroy a company, or, a company is in a vulnerable place/situation, and they want to gain from their suffering by exacerbating the problem with the sole purpose to gain from it.

Nothing wrong with shorting a stock as a practice in a traditional sense. It's actually even good for the market to a degree.

But when you start to add corruption, colluding, synthetic shares, shorting more shares than what actually exists/available, lobbying etc. the whole fucking ball game changes and now add PFOF systems, you can really see where the sentiments come from. This has been going on throughout time in the markets, this is not a ""new"" thing and there is public evidence and lists of real world examples of this occurring.

It's not a ""We hate hedge funds"" type of thing, it's more of a, there's specific hedge funds out there that their sole business models is too heavily short and destroy companies with the goal to achieve max gain in profits. Regardless if it takes jobs away from people, removes yet another revenue generating business that pay taxes to our country, and so forth, as long as the SHF get their bottom line, they don't care. Often times, businesses/companies are specifically targeted for other reasons then a failing business model.

See, thats vastly different than let's say, shorting a stock because it is simply failing as a company. 

When you start to target businesses and invest large sums of money and resources to ensure that those businesses fail, that is when we are no longer walking the ""ethical"" line.

An example, when Soros shorted the British pound. If you don't know the workings of that, you should check it out.

There is so much information out there to educate oneself, but just generally speaking, GME has everything and more in common with all of these massively recorded short squeezes. 

This is where the chanting of MOASS comes from. 

GameStop has not squeezed and the more that time goes by, the worse it gets for those shorting it.

Generally speaking, GME is the fucking ""Little Boy"" (Atomic Bomb) for those SHF firms that shorted this stock.

Whatever your views or opinions are on this, just know, that this is a real thing, and these are not just memes lol.

I am not a fanboy, I only hold a few shares of GME, my shares are not DRS'd, but I do believe what's going on with GME could very well be a significant and Guinness Book of World Records type of shit.

The purpose of this post was just to provide some history and real world examples for those intrigued.

Hedgies are manipulating stock through naked short selling by using illegal buy-write strategy on options. Let's fight against corruption. We need to raise our voice against these criminals.

They have been shorting 50-60% of daily volume (per fintel data).  Can we get squeeze ?

Everything looks almost exactly similar to the market right before the Christmas rally on the December 20th. On that date, the market tanked almost 3%. 

Today's market looks exactly like that. We had previously bounced weakly off the 50dma, forming a rising wedge. The rising wedge then broke down to a chart full of air pocket gaps on the way up.  

Again, I am not saying this will happen for sure, but the set-up on the charts almost looks exactly like that. On 12/20, the vix spiked up to almost 28 and the SPX dropped close to 130 points.

5784,wallstreetbets,BBBY - Company is squeezing shorts!,"Hi all, 

Here is a brief run-down on what is happening with BBBY. 

Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) was jumping today after what many called a bad earnings report. So, you may be wondering why. Well, there were a few hidden gems in the earning calls, one being the continued growth of Buy Buy Baby, the company adding 500,000 new rewards members, and another being the improved margins. However, I think it is because shorts got greedy and are trapped as a result of a share buyback program with 300 million left to be purchased by the end of Feb. 

According to Yahoo, 21.42 million shares are shorted which is 47% of the free float. If the company purchases another $300 million worth of shares, which is approximately another 19 to 20 million shares that means 80 to 90% of the free float needs to be purchased between the buybacks and shorts.  

To sum up my thesis to you like-minded degenerates, the company is squeezing shorts,so I jumped in because this could turn into some real fun. Currently, Bed Bath and Beyond is trading near a low level of support. So, in my opinion, it's still a good time to get in.

One example is that people have false memories of news reports aired after Nelson Mandela died in prison, another is that everybody seems to think that ""Berenstain Bears"" was spelled ""Berenstein"".  She asked if I had ever experienced anything like this and I said that I was pretty sure Wendy from the Wendy's restaurant sign got hotter.  She looked it up on her phone and it turns out that they just changed the sign.  Also she said that ""Wendy"" was ten years old which I didn't know or I wouldn't have said that, but she does looks better so I don't think it's that weird to say.

Wendy's trades at a PE ratio of 29.  They've got this feature called a ""dividend"" where they deposit money into your fucking account.  If you put a million dollars into this stock they will send you $20000 (yes TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS) of the money they made EVERY YEAR.  Most of the shit people buy on here will never make money, they are literally making so much they are giving it back to us.

I know a lot of people on here have blown up their accounts, this is about as safe a bet as you can make.  Think of how poetic it would be to be working at the Wendy's dumpster, buy this stock, and eventually come full circle and be the customer at the Wendy's dumpster (leave a good tip).  Also ever since I bought these shares I go right to the front of the line and tell them I'm the owner, which is technically true, and get them to put an express on my nuggets because I can legally do that.

5866,wallstreetbets,My GME DD from 340d ago,"By now we’ve all heard the news from the WSJ regarding NFT’s and GME. With that, I thought it would be fun to post my DD submission from 340d ago that was removed/not published with no explanation.

I’ve copied it, word for word, from that submission below. Also, I have pics of the original post but the auto mod keeps removing my posts. I’ll add it in a comment.

Start of original post:

Relativity new here but I am a business strategist at heart and thought we could talk about the roadmap for GameStop.

GameStop has committed to developing its presence in e-commerce.  How? What does that mean? You’re going to compete with Amazon? I don’t think they’re crazy enough to believe that. So what is the thought process?

I think they have a legitimate opportunity to become one of the largest digital storefronts within the video game market.  Hear me out.

Gamers LOVE to collect things. Video game makers have long understood this and make a TON of money selling skins, costumes, backgrounds and more for their characters. I’ve even made a couple hundred bucks selling Rocket league trade agreements myself. But it was a pain in the ass. And therein lies GameStop’s opportunity.

The premier digital storefront for exchanging digital content including a used game marketplace for digitally purchased games.

With the global video game market valued at nearly $160B with growth expected to reach nearly [$218B by 2023](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/newzoo-games-market-numbers-revenues-and-audience-2020-2023/), gamers have shown that they don’t mind spending money. Especially on something they want.

In steps GameStop. Facilitating sales transactions or trades for any digital object in your favorite video games. I’d have no problem auctioning off my favorite heatwave skin from rocket league. Or kids pooling all the resources they spent hours farming for the new Fortnite skin they’ve had their eye on! GameStop receives a small fee and everyone is happy.

The used game storefront may be a particularly tricky challenge, however, Microsoft has consistently shown (recently) that they are more than happy to share revenues as long as the transaction occurs on their platform. This is clearly demonstrated with their recent partnership with our very own GameStop.

In October of last year it was reported that GameStop will receive a [portion of the digital revenue for any console that was sold in their store.](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-15-microsoft-will-share-digital-revenues-with-gamestop-on-every-xbox-it-sells). This additional revenue stream lasts the entirety of the console’s life, even after a secondary sale.

It was further reported that GameStop will convert its entire [business operations platform](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/) to the Microsoft 365 suite of software. It is in Microsoft’s interest that GameStop thrives.

And finally, the growth of digital revenue as compared to retail in the video game market. From 2009-2017 the two revenue streams completely flipped their positions. Digital revenue accounts for [80% of all revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/190225/digital-and-physical-game-sales-in-the-us-since-2009/) where just 10 years ago it accounted for closer to 20%. This represents a seismic market shift in where consumers are spending money. While we’ve seen this same trend play out across all entertainment sectors, video games are woefully behind the curve with many walled garden strategies still in play.

As digital ownership continues to play the leading role in revenue generation consumers are increasingly demanding greater ability to transfer ownership of digital licenses. This is a market challenge that GameStop has an opportunity to seize on, innovate within, and thrive; both solving a major market gap and moving themselves to the forefront of the continuing digital revolution. And thanks to our infusion of capital it is a very realistic possibility.",1641513818

5888,wallstreetbets,What will happen to our money tomorrow?,"Hi guys

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few days, we've all noticed the market drop and knowing that money doesn't simply disappear from existence (except for legal debt repayment), I'm learning and plotting where the money is going.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I saw cryptocurrencies get choked off in every way. Then I saw stocks being killed as well, but then I also noticed that gold and silver were also falling. Finally, 10-year note rates are rising (indicating a lack of interest in them).

&amp;#x200B;

What else have I not seen? What is the spike that is proportional to the decline?

&amp;#x200B;

Incredibly, the money (from the sale) is just being credited to the account, but I think that's unlikely given its statutory inflationary nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the money has been used to pay off loans that themselves only exist in print - so the money will cease to exist (deflation). But I doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading my essay. I'm not an economist, just a guy who likes to manage to get his money expanded even more, so if you're interested too, then we can talk.",1641512590

5893,wallstreetbets,Recent developments on $HIMX,"As of today, the stock price of Himax has had an enormous run from 10 to 16$ in less than a month which was followed by a massive drop of 25% to the 12$ line in just three days. Regarding this unexpected drop I wanted to update my view on the stock and the company itself.

As of now, I don't (and probably can't) know why exactly this immense price decrease took place. The most common theories are that it was either a whale exiting positions and thereby triggering stop losses and panic selling or it was short sellers doubling down and having to bring an end to the rally we saw end of year. Nevertheless, both of these explanations don't change anything about the stocks potential in the long term.

What a lot of trading/investing pros keep repeating is that when a stock isn't doing what you expect it to do, you have to sit back and look at it's fundamentals again. That's exactly what I've been doing for the last days and I've found that the company is in the exact same position (If not a better one) than three weeks ago. Fundamentals still check out and the opportunites behind this haven't vanished at all. (You can check out my earlier posts to learn more about my investment thesis)

You have to keep in mind that this is a long term play. I'm personally not expecting us to hit 25$ before mid 2022. The volatility that we've seen in the last weeks is normal and it will probably continue like this for the next months.

Because of the volatility we've been seeing and the big opportunities being long term I highly adivse you to either buy LEAPS or stocks as you don't want to see your whole portfolio wiped away by badly placed options (or maybe you do, idk, this is wsb). 

This is pretty much all I've got to say about the recent price development. The stock stays massively undervalued and the market just hasn't priced in the recent earnings growth and the company's huge business opportunites which basically makes Himax a no-brainer.

I wish us all good luck on this one and we'll see us again in a few months when LEAPS will be printing.

Cheers.

*Competitors:*

In order to undergo the comparable analysis, we need to get an idea of their closest competitors. These competitors must operate in the same space, operate in similar geographies, be of similar market cap, and have valid financial ratios. Using this criterion, I cam up with the following.

· [**$EL – Estee Lauder:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/EL) Estee Lauder Inc. manufactures, markets, and sells skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products worldwide. The company offers a range of skin care products, (moisturizers, serums, cleansers etc.); and makeup products, (lipstick, foundation, brushes etc.). It also provides fragrance products in various forms comprising eau de parfum sprays (cologne, perfumes, candles etc.); and hair care products (shampoo, conditioner, sprays etc.). Some of their most notable subsidiaries include Estee Lauder, Clinique, Jo Malone London, and The Ordinary.

· [**$CL – Colgate Palmolive**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CL)**:** Colgate-Palmolive manufactures and sells consumer products worldwide. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment's products include toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar and liquid hand soaps, shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, deodorants, detergents, and cleaners. The Pet Nutrition segment offers pet nutrition products for everyday nutritional needs; and a range of therapeutic products to manage disease conditions in dogs and cats. Their most notable companies and subsidiaries include Colgate, Palmolive, Irish Spring, Speed Stick, Softsoap, and Ajax.

· [**$KMB – Kimberly-Clark**](https://utradea.com/stocks/KMB)**:** Kimberly-Clark manufactures and markets personal care and consumer tissue products worldwide. The Personal Care segment offers baby products, feminine care products, under their well-known subsidiaries such as, Pull-Ups, Kotex, Depend, and Poise, (among others). The Consumer Tissue segment provides facial and bathroom tissues, paper towels, napkins, under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, and other brand names.

· [**$CHD – Church &amp; Dwight Co:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CHD) Church &amp; Dwight develops, manufactures, and markets household, personal care, and specialty products in the United States and internationally. The company offers cat litters, carpet deodorizers, laundry detergents, and baking soda, as well as other baking soda based products under the ARM &amp; HAMMER brand; condoms, lubricants, and vibrators under the TROJAN brand; stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergents, and bleach alternatives under the OXICLEAN brand; battery-operated and manual toothbrushes under the SPINBRUSH brand; home pregnancy and ovulation test kits under the FIRST RESPONSE brand; depilatories under the NAIR brand;.

*Financial Information:*

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Unilever was able to increase their net income after tax by 0.8%, increase their net cash flow (from operations) by 11.7%, and increase their free cash flow by 26% YoY. These metrics that Unilever was able to increase are arguable he most important metrics that affect the UL stock.

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Unilever’s Turnover decreased by 2.4%, their operating profit decreased by 4.7%, their pre-tax profit decreased by 3.5%, and their basic &amp; diluted EPS’s fell by $0.02 since 2019. The decrease in EPS most likely had the most effect on the UL stock.

***Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*

By comparing Unilever’s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the “competitors” section) I found the following:

*PE Ratio:*

Based off of Unilever’s Price to Earnings Ratio in comparison to their competitors, $UL stock should be valued at $68.92/share, which would imply a share price increase of 28%. This is a little high, so I decided to take another comparable.

*P/S Ratio:*

Unilever’s P/S ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that the UL stock should have a fair value of $115.10/share, which would imply an upside potential of 114%. This is very high and somewhat unrealistic, so I decided to undergo one last comparable.

*EV/Revenue Ratio:*

Unilever’s EV/Revenue ratio indicates that their fair value is $67.59/share, which would translate into an upside potential of 26%. All 3 comparable analyses are in agreeance that Unilever is undervalued, however the results vary heavily.

*Comparable Valuation:*

Due to the variability between comparable analyses, I decided to take a weighted average of the 3 comps. I decided on a 40%, 40%, and 20% split between the P/E, EV/Revenue, and the P/S ratios. I decided to do this as the P/E and EV/Revenue results were consistent and more likely to be correct. By doing this I arrived at a final comparable valuation of $77.63/share, which implies an upside of 44%

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

The comparable analyses tell quite a different story than the DCF model will. This is due to the fact that Unilever has plateaued their growth over the past couple years, which make their ratios look low on paper. However, by inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, it arrived at a fair valuation of $UL stock of $53.13/share, which implies a slight downside of 1.1% (which essentially means that Unilever is at their fair value according to the DCF).

*Dividend Discount Model: (Visual at the end of this analysis)*

My dividend discount model uses the current annual dividend amount in combination with Unilever’s average annual dividend growth (over the past 4 years), and their WACC (as found in the DCF model). By using these metrics, I was able to find Unilever’s fair value to be $63.18/share, which implies an upside of 18%. Once again this is very close to their current fair value, which indicates that Unilever is a decent buy.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $UL stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF, and the Dividend Discount Model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $UL stock of $64.64/share, which implies an upside of 20%.

***Investment Plan:***

My plan for an investment in the $UL stock would go as follows:

· Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $55/share.

· Hold long-term (with dividend re-investment)

· Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially their financial reports to see if they can kick-start their sales growth).

***Risks:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, there were many concerning metrics that arose from their financial statements. Namely, their sales, operating profit, and pre-tax income all declining. If these trends continue, long term investors will start to trim their positions as they do not want to be holding onto declining stocks with grim futures ahead of them.

***Catalysts:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, Unilever reported an overall bad earnings report as they declined in many areas. However, they were able to save grace as their net income (after tax) and their free cash flows grew. These are two very important metrics in valuations and can help investors to spot a good long-term future in Unilever.",1641507271

Any ideas?   


My first post was removed for being too short so here are some lyrics from a song I like:   


 

Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage  
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?  
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain  
I'm tryin' to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste  
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch  
Deep in a self imposed Stockholm and Lima influx  
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks  
Made any mingling akin to bein' seasoned and stuffed  
It's a theatre of jumpin' jellyfish, jealous little sycophants  
Miserable and flimsy from the skivvys to the pissy pants  
Each one seperately convinced  
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands  
Delusion turn a communication of prison camp  
You fuckin' dorks ain't a threat to the cause  
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost  
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts  
Step out the tempest to measure  
Of what the spectrum involves  
Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene  
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe  
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive  
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe  
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong  
The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog  
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws  
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs  
And a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry  
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling  
God almighty chop an ivory tower to piano keys  
Play your own dirge on the way to surfin' maggot beach  
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art  
You can't be cooler than the corners  
Where you source all your parts  
The poker face, all it takes a couple sordid remarks  
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark  
Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I view the rattling of sabres like a show to expose  
Insecurities exploding in emotional code  
With braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross  
Corrode a homie til his probity is notably ghost  
Before the hobby was a job he was a manager, Hell  
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle  
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill  
That you was anything menacing is a difficult sell  
In a whistle-and-bellorama, black mollies to dress up like piranha  
It's not even compelling melodrama  
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga  
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata  
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need  
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed  
I'm off in coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen  
Don't make 'em show the regency what disobedient means  
Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

*Competitors:*

In order to undergo the comparable analysis, we need to get an idea of their closest competitors. These competitors must operate in the same space, operate in similar geographies, be of similar market cap, and have valid financial ratios. Using this criterion, I cam up with the following.

· [**$EL – Estee Lauder:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/EL) Estee Lauder Inc. manufactures, markets, and sells skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products worldwide. The company offers a range of skin care products, (moisturizers, serums, cleansers etc.); and makeup products, (lipstick, foundation, brushes etc.). It also provides fragrance products in various forms comprising eau de parfum sprays (cologne, perfumes, candles etc.); and hair care products (shampoo, conditioner, sprays etc.). Some of their most notable subsidiaries include Estee Lauder, Clinique, Jo Malone London, and The Ordinary.

· [**$CL – Colgate Palmolive**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CL)**:** Colgate-Palmolive manufactures and sells consumer products worldwide. The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment's products include toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, bar and liquid hand soaps, shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, deodorants, detergents, and cleaners. The Pet Nutrition segment offers pet nutrition products for everyday nutritional needs; and a range of therapeutic products to manage disease conditions in dogs and cats. Their most notable companies and subsidiaries include Colgate, Palmolive, Irish Spring, Speed Stick, Softsoap, and Ajax. 

· [**$KMB – Kimberly-Clark**](https://utradea.com/stocks/KMB)**:** Kimberly-Clark manufactures and markets personal care and consumer tissue products worldwide. The Personal Care segment offers baby products, feminine care products, under their well-known subsidiaries such as, Pull-Ups, Kotex, Depend, and Poise, (among others). The Consumer Tissue segment provides facial and bathroom tissues, paper towels, napkins, under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, and other brand names. 

· [**$CHD – Church &amp; Dwight Co:**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CHD) Church &amp; Dwight develops, manufactures, and markets household, personal care, and specialty products in the United States and internationally. The company offers cat litters, carpet deodorizers, laundry detergents, and baking soda, as well as other baking soda based products under the ARM &amp; HAMMER brand; condoms, lubricants, and vibrators under the TROJAN brand; stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergents, and bleach alternatives under the OXICLEAN brand; battery-operated and manual toothbrushes under the SPINBRUSH brand; home pregnancy and ovulation test kits under the FIRST RESPONSE brand; depilatories under the NAIR brand;.

*Financial Information:*

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Unilever was able to increase their net income after tax by 0.8%, increase their net cash flow (from operations) by 11.7%, and increase their free cash flow by 26% YoY. These metrics that Unilever was able to increase are arguable he most important metrics that affect the UL stock.

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Unilever’s Turnover decreased by 2.4%, their operating profit decreased by 4.7%, their pre-tax profit decreased by 3.5%, and their basic &amp; diluted EPS’s fell by $0.02 since 2019. The decrease in EPS most likely had the most effect on the UL stock.

***Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*

By comparing Unilever’s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the “competitors” section) I found the following: 

*PE Ratio:* 

Based off of Unilever’s Price to Earnings Ratio in comparison to their competitors, $UL stock should be valued at $68.92/share, which would imply a share price increase of 28%. This is a little high, so I decided to take another comparable.

*P/S Ratio:*

Unilever’s P/S ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that the UL stock should have a  fair value of $115.10/share, which would imply an upside potential of 114%. This is very high and somewhat unrealistic, so I decided to undergo one last comparable.

*EV/Revenue Ratio:*

Unilever’s EV/Revenue ratio indicates that their fair value is $67.59/share, which would translate into an upside potential of 26%. All 3 comparable analyses are in agreeance that Unilever is undervalued, however the results vary heavily.

*Comparable Valuation:*

Due to the variability between comparable analyses, I decided to take a weighted average of the 3 comps. I decided on a 40%, 40%, and 20% split between the P/E, EV/Revenue, and the P/S ratios. I decided to do this as the P/E and EV/Revenue results were consistent and more likely to be correct. By doing this I arrived at a final comparable valuation of $77.63/share, which implies an upside of 44%

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

The comparable analyses tell quite a different story than the DCF model will. This is due to the fact that Unilever has plateaued their growth over the past couple years, which make their ratios look low on paper. However, by inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, it arrived at a fair valuation of $UL stock of $53.13/share, which implies a slight downside of 1.1% (which essentially means that Unilever is at their fair value according to the DCF).

*Dividend Discount Model: (Visual at the end of this analysis)*

My dividend discount model uses the current annual dividend amount in combination with Unilever’s average annual dividend growth (over the past 4 years), and their WACC (as found in the DCF model). By using these metrics, I was able to find Unilever’s fair value to be $63.18/share, which implies an upside of 18%. Once again this is very close to their current fair value, which indicates that Unilever is a decent buy.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $UL stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF, and the Dividend Discount Model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $UL stock of $64.64/share, which implies an upside of 20%.

***Investment Plan:***

My plan for an investment in the $UL stock would go as follows: 

· Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $55/share.

· Hold long-term (with dividend re-investment)

· Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially their financial reports to see if they can kick-start their sales growth).

***Risks:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, there were many concerning metrics that arose from their financial statements. Namely, their sales, operating profit, and pre-tax income all declining. If these trends continue, long term investors will start to trim their positions as they do not want to be holding onto declining stocks with grim futures ahead of them.

***Catalysts:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, Unilever reported an overall bad earnings report as they declined in many areas. However, they were able to save grace as their net income (after tax) and their free cash flows grew. These are two very important metrics in valuations and can help investors to spot a good long-term future in Unilever.",1641507050

P.S SCHOOL TEXT AND I'M NEW TO STOCKS DON'T HATE ENJOY! 🐵 

&amp;#x200B;

What has happened in the stock market last week was extraordinary. If you don’t live under a rock, you have surely heard about the Game Stop stock in the news outlets.  

Now let’s get talking about why this is so important.  

Hegde funders the professionals who are millionaires and who invest millions into the stock market. They use a tactic in the stock market called short selling. Let me simply explain this, they borrow stocks from people and then they sell all the stocks they have borrowed when the market price on that stock is high. Later they hope that specific stock will drop in price. Now the stock price is down, and they buy back the stocks and give them back to people. Making them millions in profit.  

What happened was that people from forums got all together and found a penny stock they all invest in, and they blew it to the moon. Which then got caught up by the media and more people joined the gravy train.  

Now further some explanation. Hedge funders trying to short the stock, while forum users exploded the stock, so the hedge funders lost a lot of money while trying to use their short-selling tactic. The app the forum users are using to buy the stocks with got blackmailed by an unknown source, some speculations are made that hedge funders are the one’s behind this. And they turned off the buy option for the Game Stop stock and other’s stock like Nokia and AMC was also turned off. Stopping hedge funders from losing money and letting them short their stock in peace.  

Now, this is still ongoing to this day, but some changes have happened to the app they turned on the buy option. And hedge funders are still losing money. The app forum users were using is now facing a class-action lawsuit for stock market manipulation.

6001,wallstreetbets,GME 2.0?,"GameStop Corp. is launching a division to develop a marketplace for nonfungible tokens and establish coin partnerships, according to people familiar with its plans, pushing the company into much-hyped areas as it tries to turn around its core videogame business.

The retailer has hired more than 20 people to run the unit, which is building an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of virtual videogame goods such as avatar outfits and weapons, according to the people. The company is asking select game developers and publishers to list NFTs on its marketplace when it launches later this year, the people said.

GameStop also is close to signing partnerships with two coin companies to share technology and co-invest in the development of games that use blockchain and NFT technology, as well as other NFT-related projects, the people said. The retailer expects to enter into similar agreements with a dozen or more coin companies and invest tens of millions of dollars in them this year, the people said.

Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop has been working to reset its business after years of losses. The company was at the center of a stock-trading frenzy last year that dramatically boosted its share price, which rode a surge in interest and optimism from individual investors. Many saw potential in GameStop despite the pandemic’s negative impact on foot traffic and even though consumers have been increasingly opting to download and stream games over the internet, rather than buy the kind of hard copies that the company specializes in selling.

Last year, GameStop overhauled its executive team and board of directors, naming activist investor Ryan Cohen as chairman. Mr. Cohen, who co-founded online pet-products retailer Chewy Inc. and sold it for $3.35 billion in 2017, has been pushing to make GameStop more tech-centric.",1641506534

I was just poking around looking for stocks to trade after hours and I saw something weird on the F chart.  Check out that huge volume spike after hours.  Someone bought like 3.5 million shares and then another 400k or so in multiple trades right afterwards.

I am not smart but I heard that institutional investors do a lot of after-hours trading.  You can notice that the 4 million share volume had almost 0 effect on price.  That implies that there was sufficient volume on the sell side to fill the trade, which boggles my mind.  Maybe someone with a bigger brain can explain why the price didn't shoot up after a big buy like that.

Either way, it seems like a 4 million share buy after a big run up in trading today means someone is confident in this stock.  Someone with $96 million dollars burning a hole in their pocket.",1641506214

6106,wallstreetbets,GME Anniversary Implications,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion - I know everyone says that but in this case, it has to be.

GME's anniversary of it's first rocket is coming up, and I'm worried it's going to take a huge dump after.

Reasoning: Many who were in before the rocket, or the earlish stages, have hedl in part due to the difference in short term vs. long term gains.

Once they reach that 1 year mark, they may be so inclined to take gains now that they only have to pay short term taxes and limit exposure.

This could potentially be a ton of money.  Don't get me, I'm a huge fan of GME - my best gains have been from it but I'm guessing that the rest of this month will be anything from boring.

Best of luck! Stay safe!

Do not sell or sell only what is needed to basic human needs (eat, drink ). 
Paper hands are the ones losing the money. Everyone needs to be reminded that. This correction are whales and smart money hunting for paper hands. 
Don’t give them anything. Or if you have to give them as less as possible. 
If needed you can go to into some debt on your banking card (IF it doesn’t give you penalty fees) 
But what you need to calculate is the cost of losing the opportunity by missing future gains. And the cost that it cost you to go into debt right now. 
If you have a stable income where you know that the short term debt that you re taken by going up to 1000-2000 dollars into bank card penalties won’t be a problem to refund next month. And holdings allows to go home for future gains that will be higher than the penalty fees.",1641497245

This a decent company, I own shoes from them, they have a focus on sustainability, innovative materials and other things that’ll appeal to the Millenials and Gen Z. I feel there’s a lot of potential here. Like any new business, their revenue is growing at the cost of profitability, however, a $25M net loss over a year on a revenue of $250M isn’t bad for a growing business (2020)

All analysts covering this stock are either neutral or bullish with a target price range of $17-$30 and the stock is trading at $14 as of this morning. A bit crazy that this stock is being shorted so heavily.

Furthermore, the short squeeze already happened. The stock went from $2 to $74. Over half of the comments made in meme subreddits occurred prior to May 2021 which was when enthusiasm was at its highest.

At this point I think that the handful of hopefuls left in the meme subreddits are the ultimate bag-holders. Completely deluded, cursing Kenny G every day and talking about conspiracy theories.

$EAR was in the news on September 23, 2021 because the DOJ announced an investigation into the company related to insurance claims. Analists at various firms like JPM, William Blair and others cut their targets by over 75%. 

$EAR management responded by withdrawing FY21 guidance, and shared that it was subject to an ongoing claims audit by its largest third-party payor. Why is this important? Shared slumped over 60% minutes after the announcement. 

The shares were trading around \~$21 around the time of the announcement. This is important to remember.

Like if there's a large company, and they pay their staff basically as little as possible, keep the staff from doing full time in order to not pay benefits, and generally is known for overworking and undervaluing staff.  I know it used to be a sign that the company is going to have some good profits, and stocks go up.  But more and more i'm worried that these companies will have massive disruption events from staff (like a strike or walk out).  They have to be getting hit on hiring in the current market where people aren't taking the lowest wage jobs anymore.  So they're going to have be be paying more which will increase their bottom line.

6289,wallstreetbets,Stonks with the highest and lowest Implied Volatilities relative to the past,"Hi guys,

it seems a lot of you are struggling with finding  stonks with low or high implied volatilities (relative to the past) as most retail brokers dont offer this data easily. Luckily, these days are gone, because by scraping  [Alpha Query](https://www.alphaquery.com/) you can get historical IV data for almost all major stocks (certainly those with weekly expirations).

To save you a lot of time and make sure you are on your golden path to tendies I have scraped past IVs for stonks with at least 1000 traded options on average per day in the last 90 days (to make sure there is at least some liquidity) with weekly expirations (data from [CBOE weekly options list](https://www.cboe.com/us/options/symboldir/weeklys_options/)). Data on average option volume can be obtained on [Market Chameleon Option Volume](https://marketchameleon.com/Reports/optionVolumeReport).

Here comes the magical file you have all been waiting for (unfortunately, I can not predict the bigest move 1 day in advance, so this will have to do it).

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFtUwDKHSyoPtQuowat9kCnCuFGFq5YCwDZlIdZ0R9k/edit?usp=sharing&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFtUwDKHSyoPtQuowat9kCnCuFGFq5YCwDZlIdZ0R9k/edit?usp=sharing&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)

How to read this table? The first two columns Symbol and Date are pretty self-explanatory, Nrow means how many data points per Symbol were used for calculation of past quantiles, IV\_10d and IV\_30d are the implied volatility of the stock with weighted expiration 10 and 30 days from now (if there is no expiration exactly 10 or 30 days from now, IVs are weighted by taking the nearest expirations from above and below). The last two rows show how extreme current Ivs are relative to the past: So, if we look at GPRO, Past\_Quantile\_IV\_10d is 0.05 and Past\_Quantile\_IV\_30d is 0.01, which means that GPRO ATM options expiring on Jan 8th have low IVs relative to the past - only 5% of time it has been lower and ATM options expiring Feb 4th (29 days from now) have almost the lowest IV in history - only 1% of IVs in the past have been lower in the past. To put it more bluntly, because we have 1558 days with data for GPRO, only 15 days in history had lower IV that it is today, so BUY BUY BUY, because it is as low as it gets! If the Number in the last two columns is close to 1 (BABA), it means IVs are very high compared to the past, so selling options makes sense.

TL;DR Check the google docs link and buy options on stonks where the number in the last two columns is close to 0 and sell options if its close to 1.",1641490210

I'm back with more under the radar Sonos DD. 

Sometime this afternoon (most likely afterhours) the Sonos/Google patent case is going to get its final ruling by the ITC.  In the first round Sonos won, so right now its up to the ITC to decide if they want to go ahead and enforce the ruling as is or let Google continue to infringe on Sonos's patents.  

Given the political winds nationally, its highly unlikely that they allow Google to get away with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.  Especially given how innovative of a company Sonos is.   

I'm expecting a ruling to go in favor of Sonos and Sonos to see a similar bump they did when the last ruling came down (+15% opened even higher at close to +30%).  

This might be worth a 1DTE lotto.  I tossed down 100 Sonos 1/7 calls at the 30 strike.  Obviously do your own DD and understand your risk tolerance, but I expecting good things from this underrated company.",1641489467

he reset of the Capitalistic US economy is soon coming to an end. These are all planned events, from COVID and the vaccine, Shortage and other needed items, and finally the CRASH of the FED and the stock market. **Check out links at bottom of post!!**

**Need a Tin Foil hat for this:**

The United States has the worlds largest army in the world by a very LARGE margin and countries know that they would stand no chance in trying to deal with that problem. Would be much easier and less costly for a country to train sleeper agents or develop people to become a person of power. Where I am trying to get at is that the US and China are #1 and #2 in world power and who stands to gain the most with the down fall of both countries.... Russia!

The Reset that is coming is a Russian Government agency lead move to put power back into Russia hands Pre WW2. Forget about communist government and economic systems. We will soon be in a Oligarchy Government and Economy with groups of people in control or a Forum broken down into sectors such as Pharma/Tech/Food ETC....

This is only the begging of the end of capitalism as we know it. Just be ready for the take down and know it was all a planned event to make it look like a ""Pandemic""

GME: with no one talking about meme stocks anymore, this will undoubtedly fall under $100. 


AMC: See GME.  I expect this one to fall under $15. 


WISH: let's face it, in an era where flexing money on social media is all the rage, discount brands are in a really bad spot.  I could see this one falling under $2.


SDC: Goldman is massively shorting this and making sure it falls under $2, so under $2 is basically guaranteed.  In addition, SDC is in massive debt, so I expect it to fall under $1.50. 


HOOD: Robinhood lost the respect of the retail trader community when they screwed over WSB last year.  This one's falling under $10.  

MNMD: Shroom legalization ain't happening.  Under $1.


ARKK:  Let's face it, Cathie Wood's no Warren Buffet.  In fact, she's a moron who just happened to get into momentum trading before retail trading really blew up; pretty much just a glorified Gary Vee.  I expect this one to fall below $75.",1641483687

“This time its different”

Well actually yes, this time it is different. For years, Tesla has been enjoying extremely high premiums due to their potential growth and a complete lack of serious competitors. This year and next year that is all about to change. Nearly EVERY single car manufacturer is releasing a direct competitor to Tesla in 2022.

Tesla is priced at around 1.2 trillion on 46 billion in Revenue while Ford is priced at 100 billion on 134 billion revenue. Tesla is priced as if they will sell just as many cars as every single car manufacturer listed above in the regular gas guzzling category. Clearly this is not going to happen. Go to Europe and ask people if they would rather drive a BMW/Mercedes EV or a Tesla. The answer will almost always be BMW/Mercedes. Tesla thrived when their was no market/competitors but when they have to go and compete against BMW, Tesla does not offer anything uniquely advantages that these other companies can offer. 

The cyber truck is also going to flop hard when they are competing against the number 1 best selling pick up truck which will be cranking out 150,000 trucks a year. [Ford plans to double production of its electric F-150 Lightning to keep up with surging demand (yahoo.com)](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ford-plans-double-production-electric-155707504.html). By 2023 Ford will be putting out 600,000 EVs a year. This is one company valued as 100 billion putting out nearly as much as Tesla in the EV category while Tesla is worth 1.2 trillion. Tesla will lose its unique appeal of being the only serious EV and hindered by the fact that there is a Ford/Toyota/Hyundai in literally every small town to test drive the new EVs, Tesla will be the last choice for most people in the EV market.

Prediction: 

The moment Tesla posts stagnant growth due to their competitors upscaling their EV lines, Tesla will no longer be a growth stock. Their position will be permanently cemented and as such their stock price will crater by upwards of 20-30% in a single day. Look at Zoom, Docusign, and Peloton stock when their quarterly posted stagnant growth. Massive drop the next day.

6433,wallstreetbets,Two Words: Long Dick’s.,"The company: Dick’s Sporting Goods.

This isn’t gonna be a super in-depth DD, but it’s what you really need to know.

Dick’s Sporting Goods is a company. They sell sporting goods. Pretty self explanatory. They’re trading at $112/shr.

Let’s take a look at sub-sector growth. Academy Sports ($ASO), another comparable stock (sports is in the name again boys) is forecasting FY21 sales growth [@17-18%](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/academy-sports-outdoors-raises-2021-guidance-271639142052), meanwhile Dick’s is forecasting 25.8-26.1% as per a pre-market update today. The sporting goods company with a five in its name (banned on this subreddit), another comparable company, has had revenue growth of 18.4% (you’re gonna have to look that up to believe me) up to Q3. It’s clear not only that sporting goods (along with broader retail) is growing quickly, but that Dick’s Sporting Goods is the market leader.

Yearly EPS for Dick’s Sporting Goods are up from $3.69 in 2019, $6.12 in 2020, to $15.5-15.6 (company estimate as of today’s pre-market update). That’s a 321% increase in two years, and a 154% increase over last year. Their PE ratio based off their FY forecast is 7.1x. Their P/S ratio based off their forecast is 0.76x.

Let’s compare this with the broader retail sector. As of Q3 2021, specialty retail trades at [an average PE of 18.92x and P/S ratio of 1.14x.](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

Assuming Dick’s rise up (intentional grammar) to the average PE ratio of speciality retail, the price per share would be $294/shr. However, specialty retail and retail in general is prices by P/S. Should they revert to the average P/S ratio of 1.14x, the price per share of Dick’s would be $167/shr.

Average price targets among analysts sits at an average of $150, or as high as $19 [(source)](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DKS/research-ratings).

But get this: the short interest as of December 15th is 18.6%. Huh?! SHORT SQUEEZE and a solid, undervalued company?

Well, they have a positive balance sheet, which means Fed rate raises won’t affect them much. They also pay dividends (1.64%/yr).

And they just announced a $2b buyback (worth $9.35b).

This company is the silver bullet against market concerns right now, and it a a growth/value/meme/dividend/buyback investors wet dream. My price target is $180.

**There’s a fuck ton of personal opinion in this. Deal with it.**

This ain’t due diligence. If you want to be duly diligent about something then make it about the route you take walking away from here.

(I’ve kept this a lot shorter than the one for [$ARVL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rtxua8/automotive_roundup_2021_part_2_4_new_spacs_for/), which turned into a bit of a shitpost. I wrote most of it hungover on NYD - sorry not sorry!)

[u/officialbigrob](https://www.reddit.com/user/officialbigrob/) posted a [technical analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rwxdpg/goev_sitting_well_below_moving_averages_crayon/) yesterday which is worth reading - it comes from a different angle to this post

Anyway, that’s the niceties over and done with, so here we go……

Canoo ($GOEV)

5 new products promised: “Lifestyle” vehicle (&lt;Q4 ‘22), a delivery van (‘23), a sports vehicle (‘25), plus 2 additional variants of the Lifestyle vehicle

Number of employees: 700 full time, 100 contractors at Q3 report date

HQ: US, Arkansas

Mkt Cap: \~$1.8bn (NASDAQ), end Dec ‘21.

Battery Supplier: Panasonic

Planned Production Sites: US, Arkansas and Oklahoma

Pre-orders: **9,500** units (August ‘21), no model split given. Implication of a further **10,000** vans for a start-up last mile delivery company (FRONTdoor Collective), not yet included on official pre-order numbers. All orders appear to be cancellable / non-binding.

Major investors pre-SPAC: David Stern and Pak Tam “David” Li

Short Positions: \~16% with \~3.7 days cover

**Summary**

$GOEV are attempting to enter the EV space with in-house designed skateboard platforms, with which they can either contract out to other manufacturers, or build their own vehicles. Platforms are designed to incorporate battery packs as part of the structure. This leads to reduced cost and weight, but may increase risks during crash, especially side impact, though they make a point to say that this is designed for. It also allows for individual failed modules to be replaced, rather than an entire pack which is beneficial to ownership and warranty cost.

Entering the market first is the “Lifestyle” vehicle which includes a van, 5 seat and 7 seat variants, with a pick-up style vehicle at a later date. A car is also due at some point, though timing is unclear.

Manufacturing, after a deal wasn’t renewed with VDL Nedcar in Europe in November 2021, has been brought wholly in-house to a site in Arkansas and later in 2023 to Oklahoma.

At the same time they gave what appear to be mostly realistic production targets of 3,000 to 6,000 vehicles in 2022, and gave ever more optimistic minimum numbers of 14k, 40k and 70k for years up to 2025.

A deal with Hyundai Kia, announced in February 2020 to co-develop an EV (with $GOEV responsible for the platform) was killed off 13 months later.

6,900 non binding pre-orders is a low amount compared to a lot of their EV startup peers.

With SOP due before Q4 ‘22, as of the Q3 ‘21 report they have a big task to commission the manufacturing process and ensure quality.

As with a lot of the EV startups, they are making statements about monetising vehicle data, though haven’t elaborated on how this will work.

Additionally, they plan on trying to capitalise on revenue generated by beyond-first-owners, by offering a refit / repurposing business.

700 employees is a sustainable amount of people to be working in the design, engineering and business support, though it will inevitably increase as they start to produce.

Next $GOEV Report: Q4 results, approx Mid Feb / March 2022

Must Have:

* Updates on manufacturing readiness and preferably **month** for manufacturing start
* 2023 revenue estimates

Hope for:

* Progress on certification &amp; timing
* An update for pre-orders, with a significantly large increase from 6,900
* A breakdown of pre-orders by vehicle type
* A statement on what their primary sales channels are

Vehicles - Market and Engineering viewpoint and opinion. Take it or leave as you will. I don’t give a shit either way!

**Lifestyle Vehicle**

No pricing is given for the model specifics, but the website shows an entry price of $37,450 with an 80kWh battery / 250 mile range. That’s a tough price point and is likely to be for the van variant. Seat sets, doors and rear trim add to the cost of a vehicle, which will make the passenger variants more expensive, so you’re looking at Tesla Model 3/Y pricing territory.

That said, it’s not exactly in line with the US Compact Car segment - it’s closer in design and layout to a minivan, which may allow them some grace in the pricing. So really the question is, what is the US market demand for an EV minivan? With the explosion in mid and full size SUVs in recent years, the minivan segment has declined. Despite an uptick in sales last year, they still only hold around 1.5% of the market - a value which is likely to decline over the coming 12 months. So a realistic sales target would be 1% to 2% of 1.5% of the market, which is, suffice to say, not a lot. It’s worth saying that $GOEV say that the van variant is to fit a gap in the market for a small city, last mile delivery vehicle.

With that in mind, the Van variant would face least stress in-market - there is a rapidly expanding, under serviced, worldwide market in this area. The pick-up version when it is launched may attract more volume, but will enter the market against heavy competition from other EV startups, and the older OEMs.

The ladder frame (i.e. body-on-frame) construction is the cheapest structure to design and engineer, as well as being the cheapest to tool for manufacturing. However, it also adds significant weight and tends (mostly) not to perform as well as monocoques. Rear door reverse design is an interesting addition (I can't give the usual name for them as it gets the post automoderated!), though they appear to have kept the central B pillar. That’s likely to be for rollover performance. It’s not clear what the final rear seat configuration is, but there’s an implication that it could have a wraparound seat, which gets a thumbs down from me unless they can provide robust crash safety data.

500,000 cumulative miles have been accrued through testing, which at this point before launch is a solid achievement. Although fleet mileage accumulation has fallen out of favour somewhat in recent years due to the cost of running this type of activity, for a new start-up with a whole new vehicle, it’s a sensible thing to do and credit to them for doing it.

In a slide on the June 2021 IR Day presentation, there’s a comment that they use “55% less controllers”, implying that they have in-house hardware and software speciality to consolidate a number of vehicle controls to a lesser number of units. While this may provide some cost and package space saving for production and improve power consumption, if they’ve included any safety critical systems (e.g. airbags, inverter etc) then it also increases their liability and introduces a time consuming and expensive job to validate the systems.

It will also be one of the first vehicles in-market to be steer-by-wire, which removes a mechanical link between the steering wheel and the steering rack. The engineer in me is both fraught with anxiety and intrigued to know how they’ve covered the functional safety aspects, vehicle dynamics and steering feel. The system is produced by a large automotive supplier (Mando).

**Conclusion:** The passenger version, with its reversible styling (and [wtf is going on](https://www.reuters.com/technology/canoo-accelerates-us-production-plan-ends-vdl-contract-manufacturing-deal-2021-12-15/) with the glass panel at the front? Are the pictures deceiving??), is unlikely to be a sales success if they’re trying to supply to the mass market. Miracles aside, expect retail sales to be low, perhaps uneconomically low. Sales in Europe of this style vehicle are minimal. China may provide a boost if they choose this territory. Thumbs down.

The vans have potential for retail and fleet sales and I’d expect this to be the bulk of their production percentage after passenger variants have been fulfilled - the market for this has enormous worldwide revenue potential. Thumbs neutral, erring towards positive if they focus their sales effort in this area.

**Manufacturing**

Passenger variants were originally planned to be manufactured in Europe by VDL Nedcar (a Netherlands based contract manufacturing company), but the decision was made not to renew the manufacturing contract. It’s unclear who forced the decision, but economically, it’s a better move for $GOEV to manufacture in the US. As part of the breakup, VDL returned a $30.4m prepayment and purchased $8.4m of $GOEV stock.

Van variants will be manufactured in Arkansas, along with the passenger variants until a new facility is ready in Oklahoma (late ‘23) when passenger variants will move over. However this assumes that $GOEV won’t consolidate manufacturing to a single facility, based on actual sales volumes.

**Conclusion:** Capacity of 150k units a year in Oklahoma, while small by automotive factory outputs, is a big statement from $GOEV on their intended output. But any factory not running at a significantly high percentage of its capacity is expensive to run. Economically, this play will only work out if they manage to achieve volume targets.

**Financials**

Cash on Hand

Dec 20: $702m

Mar 21: $642m

Jun 21: $563m

Sept 21:$416m

Dec 21: $344m (estimate) at current burn rate, however the move of manufacturing and ramp up plans will burn cash at an increased rate.

At the current burn rate of \~$71m per month, which as stated earlier will almost certainly increase, they have 5.3 months of cash available. They have a longer period if only looking at free cash flow (19 months).

Taking the bottom end of the ‘22 volume estimate of 3,000 vehicles, a retail price of $40,000 and a high margin of 50%, that gives a pre-tax gain of $60m for 2022. The whole business is likely to need a relatively large number of annual sales for several years in order to break even. It remains to be seen if they can generate those sales with the product lineup they are offering. If $GOEV doesn’t generate higher revenue in the early part of 2023 then it may be that they need to raise more cash.",1641476442

Just joined the community today and wanted to ask more experienced, professional traders on the possibility to short the market as a retail investor in case you are overall (currently) more bearish than bullish.

I was thinking about high-risk/high-yield insurance contracts like Credit Default Swaps. Specifically I am interested if there is a possibility of buying CDSs on global indexes as a retail trader? I am not focusing here on the specific types of indexes (although high-yield (junk) are preferable to investment grade) but rather on the possibility of doing so at all. If so could you please be specific where can I do so? If not, are there any comparable high-risk/high-yield instruments for retail traders?

I kindly thank you in advance for your time. May your Karma moon like SHIBA INU in 2021! ;)",1641474675

My days now consist of trying to recoup my losses by begging for change and buying puts whenever I get the chance to log onto my Robinhood account at the public library. I'm embarrassed I've become the very thing I laughed at for so long - a gay bear. If it weren't for all the other retards living next to me in their boxes, I probably would've ended my life.

**International Macro**

1. Fed minutes: earlier or faster rate hikes may be necessary, tapering could be faster than last cycle

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday released the minutes document of the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting. The minutes show that participants noted that, given the outlook for the economy, labor market and inflation, it may be necessary to raise the federal funds rate earlier or at a faster pace than previously expected.

The minutes show that most participants believe that if the recent pace of improvement in the labor market continues, the conditions for a rate increase could be met relatively soon.

Given rising inflationary pressures and a stronger labor market, participants believed that the increase in policy accommodation associated with the current pace of net asset purchases was no longer necessary. Participants noted that the Committee should continue to be prepared to adjust the pace of bond purchases if the economic outlook changes.

2. The United States ""small non-farm"" monthly increase of more than 800,000 more than twice the analysts expected

On Wednesday (January 5), the U.S. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) announced that private sector employment grew by more than 800,000, the largest increase in nearly seven months.

ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson said in the report that December's job growth brought the average number of jobs in the fourth quarter of last year to 625,000, exceeding the average number of jobs in 2021 by 514,000.

Although the number of new jobs in 2021 exceeded 6 million, private sector employment is still nearly 4 million less than the level before the new crown virus.

3. U.S. poll: Biden's approval rating fell to a new low of 44%, 70% of respondents think the U.S. is on the wrong path

Newsweek said Biden had the support of most Americans in his first months in office, but his approval rating has been in decline since the end of August 2021.

Biden is facing an equally tricky new year - including the Democrats' attempt to pass the $1.75 trillion ""Rebuild a Better Future"" bill and other issues that remain unresolved.

4. U.S. Markit services, composite PMI in December hit a three-month low, input prices hit a record high

Data released on Wednesday showed that the U.S. Markit services and composite PMI in December hit a three-month low, and the related price sub-indexes all hit a record high. Compared to the manufacturing data released this week, the service sector appears to be more robust.

Analysis says that the current U.S. business activity is mainly driven by the service sector, manufacturing production growth rate is relatively slow.

7. The European Central Bank management Kazaks: early 2023 interest rate hike is a ""possible scenario""

**Company News**

1. The big short-seller who sang Wirecard's praises years in advance thinks Tesla shares are 10 times overvalued

Fraser Perring, who accused German payment processor Wirecard AG of fraud years before its collapse, is betting that Tesla's straight-up valuation will come back down to earth.

The operating system project had been underway for several years and involved hundreds of employees. Analysts say the project is on hold, meaning Meta's attempt to take control of its Oculus VR headset, as well as the underlying software for future augmented or mixed reality (MR) devices, has suffered a setback.

**International Macro**

1. Fed minutes: earlier or faster rate hikes may be necessary, tapering could be faster than last cycle

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday released the minutes document of the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting. The minutes show that participants noted that, given the outlook for the economy, labor market and inflation, it may be necessary to raise the federal funds rate earlier or at a faster pace than previously expected.

The minutes show that most participants believe that if the recent pace of improvement in the labor market continues, the conditions for a rate increase could be met relatively soon.

Given rising inflationary pressures and a stronger labor market, participants believed that the increase in policy accommodation associated with the current pace of net asset purchases was no longer necessary. Participants noted that the Committee should continue to be prepared to adjust the pace of bond purchases if the economic outlook changes.

2. The United States ""small non-farm"" monthly increase of more than 800,000 more than twice the analysts expected

On Wednesday (January 5), the U.S. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) announced that private sector employment grew by more than 800,000, the largest increase in nearly seven months.

ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson said in the report that December's job growth brought the average number of jobs in the fourth quarter of last year to 625,000, exceeding the average number of jobs in 2021 by 514,000.

Although the number of new jobs in 2021 exceeded 6 million, private sector employment is still nearly 4 million less than the level before the new crown virus.

3. U.S. poll: Biden's approval rating fell to a new low of 44%, 70% of respondents think the U.S. is on the wrong path

Newsweek said Biden had the support of most Americans in his first months in office, but his approval rating has been in decline since the end of August 2021.

Biden is facing an equally tricky new year - including the Democrats' attempt to pass the $1.75 trillion ""Rebuild a Better Future"" bill and other issues that remain unresolved.

4. U.S. Markit services, composite PMI in December hit a three-month low, input prices hit a record high

Data released on Wednesday showed that the U.S. Markit services and composite PMI in December hit a three-month low, and the related price sub-indexes all hit a record high. Compared to the manufacturing data released this week, the service sector appears to be more robust.

Analysis says that the current U.S. business activity is mainly driven by the service sector, manufacturing production growth rate is relatively slow.

5. The British government to cancel the new crown test requirements for travelers entering England before the line

6. Winter power supply tensions France considers liberalizing coal power station restrictions

7. The European Central Bank management Kazaks: early 2023 interest rate hike is a ""possible scenario""

ECB Governing Councilor Kazaks said the ECB is ready to raise interest rates and cut stimulus if necessary. He said the ECB will act if the outlook for inflation is high and a rate hike in early 2023 is a ""likely scenario"".

8. Chilean lawmakers asked the court to terminate 400,000 tons of lithium mine contract tender

Chilean lawmakers applied to the House of Representatives for an injunction aimed at preventing the outgoing government from accepting bids for a lithium mining contract. Chile announced last October that it was offering five 80,000-ton quotas to domestic and overseas companies for a total of 400,000 tons of exploration and production contracts, with the winning bidder to receive seven years of exploration and development projects and 20 years of production, with bids due to end in mid-January.

1. The big short-seller who sang Wirecard's praises years in advance thinks Tesla shares are 10 times overvalued

Fraser Perring, who accused German payment processor Wirecard AG of fraud years before its collapse, is betting that Tesla's straight-up valuation will come back down to earth.

The founder of Viceroy Research tweeted Wednesday that there is a ""stock price mismatch"" between Tesla and veteran automakers Toyota and Volkswagen.

2. Sources said Meta stopped developing VR/AR operating system, ""independent and autonomous"" plan setback

The system was designed primarily for its virtual reality (VR) devices and upcoming augmented reality (AR) glasses.

The operating system project had been underway for several years and involved hundreds of employees. Analysts say the project is on hold, meaning Meta's attempt to take control of its Oculus VR headset, as well as the underlying software for future augmented or mixed reality (MR) devices, has suffered a setback.

6563,wallstreetbets,U.S. stocks pre-market watch.What stocks have everyone bought recently?," Stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it may need to raise interest rates as soon as March to fight inflation. The Dow slipped 1.1%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was hit the hardest, falling more than 3%. Drops in major technology stocks were the biggest weight on the market. The software sector and many highly valued names are in significant corrections. Investors stuck with sharp losses in tech stocks may want to use any rebounds as a chance to get out rather than any opportunity to load up. Overall, investors should be taking a more defensive approach in the short run. Jobless claims and ISM services index will be released today.

So, you 🚀 to the moon and got some of your millions cached out. Of course first things first and those are the essentials:

* Post on WSB
* Buy a new charger 
* Buy a luxury car with a socket for the new charger (does lambo offer it?)
* Pay out your mortgage, student loan, credit cards, broker margin and whatever you used for yolo. (this point is debatable though)
* Probably a mansion with a huge garage for new cars 
* Buy some food supply to be able to hoddl 👐💎 longer when needed (the other option is to buy local wendys  so you can hire yourself in case of troubles) 

But what next? What the purpose of all these millions apart from loosing it all just to post it on WSB again (which is undoubtedly important part of life).

My point is that we seems like have crappy system in general and some of you acknowledge it and despite the fact the system can not be fixed overnight even with 1mm it can become a little bit better, a little bit more fair.

6596,wallstreetbets,The Impact of Digital Technologies,"Technologies can help make our world fairer, more peaceful, and more just. Digital advances can support and accelerate achievement of each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals – from ending extreme poverty to reducing maternal and infant mortality, promoting sustainable farming and decent work, and achieving universal literacy. But technologies can also threaten privacy, erode security and fuel inequality. They have implications for human rights and human agency. Like generations before, we – governments, businesses and individuals – have a choice to make in how we harness and manage new technologies.
Digital technologies have advanced more rapidly than any innovation in our history – reaching around 50 per cent of the developing world’s population in only two decades and transforming societies. By enhancing connectivity, financial inclusion, access to trade and public services, technology can be a great equaliser.

In the health sector, for instance, AI-enabled frontier technologies are helping to save lives, diagnose diseases and extend life expectancy. In education, virtual learning environments and distance learning have opened up programmes to students who would otherwise be excluded. Public services are also becoming more accessible and accountable through blockchain-powered systems, and less bureaucratically burdensome as a result of AI assistance.Big data can also support more responsive and accurate policies and programmes.

However, those yet to be connected remain cut off from the benefits of this new era and remain further behind. Many of the people left behind are women, the elderly, persons with disabilities or from ethnic or linguistic minorities, indigenous groups and residents of poor or remote areas. The pace of connectivity is slowing, even reversing, among some constituencies. For example, globally, the proportion of women using the internet is 12 per cent lower than that of men. While this gap narrowed in most regions between 2013 and 2017, it widened in the least developed countries from 30 per cent to 33 per cent.

The use of algorithms can replicate and even amplify human and systemic bias where they function on the basis of data which is not adequately diverse. Lack of diversity in the technology sector can mean that this challenge is not adequately addressed.",1641455694

I posted a DD last week pointing out the squeeze metrics of this company. A deep dive into the company and sector turned what I thought (and still is) a squeeze play into a potential value play. Here is what has convinced me to yolo into the $FATH.

**Introduction**

Love listening to this dude talk, Ryan Martin is the CEO of Fathom, he is a GO GETTER! Check out his linked in, dude worked on a farm as I kid, played college Baseball at Iowa State and became a senior exec for large firms like CDW and GE. Now he is the CEO of a company he helped build and is aiming the company right back at the conglomerates he used to work for. great podcast below, a quick CNBC interview and check out Ryan's Martin's Linked In Profile

Fathom Digital manufacturing provides rapid prototyping and on-demand production services. Fathom works with clients to take their digital designs and produce prototypes and production products at a rapid pace. They are leading the surge into Industry 4.0 Manufacturing. Todays manufacturing industry focus more on getting to market faster. Last time I saw my dad before he left for cigarettes he told me ""If your not first, your last"". The GE's, TSLA's and AMZN's of today need companies like Fathom to get to market faster. Fathoms current market share is prototyping, as companies need to get to market faster they will partner with companies like Fathom for low to mid volume production. This is where Fathom stands out and this is the gap Fathom is targeting to fill. Fathom has publicly stated that they will take an agnostic approach to any new digital manufacturing technology and will purchase anything and everything needed to support their customers and gain low to mid volume production. See ""1/4 of my Tesla is actually built by someone else. They are acquiring companies right next door to the new Tesla Headquarters right here in Austin....strategery. Fathom is essentially buying any company or technology that adds to the endgame.

9 out of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies in the world choose Fathom

Known Clients: GE, TSLA, AMZN etc. I haven't found any other direct callouts but from the list above I'm sure very reputable companies

**Capabilities**

large scale rapid prototyping and mid volume production using the following techniques: 3d printing, Injection Molding, Poly Jet Technology, FDM Technology, SLS Technology, Urethane Casting, MJF Technology, Additive Post Processing, DMLS Technology

[https:\/\/fathommfg.com\/manufacturing-capabilities](https://preview.redd.it/32tc61kgyz981.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89c68afd49f2f60656a7a81e354eba8c1bdffb94)

**Why SPAC?**

Fathom was actually a profitable Spac, most Spacs have no revenue. Fathom choose the Spac route to gain market share of the white space of customers below your AMZN's, TSLA's and GE's with brand recognition and awareness. Being a publicly traded company helps market yourself to more corporate customers. Good Housekeeping seal of approval per say

**Financials**

2020: $150 Million gross profits (previous info is lacking due to private status)

2021-2022: $1.4 Billion valuation

**Sector and Competitors**

While the sector in general is not impressive there are some great points to take away. This sector is still new all the companies listed below have been transitioning from traditional manufacturing to digital manufacturing, this is why you will see so much volatility. The industry 4.0 manufacturing companies are trying to figure out where to price itself, this could be as high as $280 or as low as $50. The specialized sector of digital manufacturing is very small my best guess in research is roughly 30 publicly traded tickers. As these companies fully transition into digital prototyping and manufacturing they will start to take away profits from the companies they manufacture for. This is the gap Fathom wants to fill first, low to mid volume production. As their market share grows here stock prices should follow. None of these companies own more than 3% of the digital manufacturing segment, and Fathom wants to acquire them all. The biggest take away from the chart below is the floor, all of these companies trade at $20+. Fathom should take over this market in the near future

FARO, PLRB, MTLS

[FARO - Floor in the $50's odd its in a different squeeze frame](https://preview.redd.it/ta1ujdiiyz981.png?width=1231&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=186676edf998cf03b9868fe901a49abffefbff69)

[MTLS - $20 floor and Jan-Feb Squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/e3y9s7nkyz981.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9ebcd93803cc885ee33b98401692d967907ed77)

**Squeeze Metrics**

2.3M Total share float, 49.2M **shares are locked up until the stock trades above $12 dollars for 20 days out of a 30-day period**, 600 shares available to short at 26.8% interest. About 2 days left to return 1M shares. This will be a $12 stock minimum maybe not tomorrow, but I expect a minimum of $50 and squeezy sector of $150

[2.3M share float, all other shares are locked up until $12](https://preview.redd.it/vpr5hhilyz981.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d5d3f364689caf013dee6c690b0b93923ba8c8)

[Borrow rate will continue to climb](https://preview.redd.it/eqzc2ivmyz981.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea2cba1230913913dad9ceb8c5941720f2946d9)

[600 shares to borrow, just needs volume](https://preview.redd.it/owiurrrnyz981.png?width=855&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcf4af475ea5b429627159a6a0e29bcf9f66ef64)

[CTB can be as high as 250&amp;#37; at times! About 2 days left to return 1M shares!](https://preview.redd.it/021fgdroyz981.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a90b964da8dbbd251e37e3828a216761a4cd2ef4)

**Technical Analysis**

Not a lot of data to chew on here since the recent de-spac, but I think we have found our floor around $6.00. If Fathom starts a squeeze I would expect a ride up into $10-$12, probably retest the $14 high. Long term if Fathom should trade to at least $30-50 like the floor of their competitors. If they start to take over the market share and acquire companies I think we see $75.

[Double bottom on the hourly chart](https://preview.redd.it/za8na50qyz981.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cde84588f6adda3c4bcf0fb658dd54526ce09be)

**Potential Catalysts**

Upcoming Needham Virtual Growth Conference 01/10/22. Baird Presentation below, should be similar to Needham.

[https://s29.q4cdn.com/435091200/files/doc\_presentations/2021/Fathom\_-\_Baird\_Presentation.pdf](https://s29.q4cdn.com/435091200/files/doc_presentations/2021/Fathom_-_Baird_Presentation.pdf)

**TL;DR**

2.3M share float, other shares locked up until at least $12. Close to bottom price, competitors trade at floors of $20+, Jan-Feb squeeze for sector could repeat. Buying up companies around new TSLA factory. Bad ass company doing bad ass things with bad ass people.

**Position**

Currently holding 1,000 shares @ $7.04 scaling in slowly. Looking for a full entry of $35k around $6.00-$6.50

*The CDC reduced the recommended quarantine for asymptomatic Covid positive healthcare worker to 5 days REGARDLESS OF A NEW POSITIVE COVID TEST without citing sufficient evidence justifying the move.* The CDC and the AHA just said that doctors should not delay CPR to put on PPE on known COVID patients. Every doctor I know is completely confused why they’d do this. Fuck the healthcare workers I guess

But if everyone is going to get Covid anyways on the next few weeks, risking additional exposure doesn’t matter. 

If the whole country gets Covid in a 2-3 week span, we are FUCKED. What if there are no essential workers? What if hospitals lose what little staff we have already? 

They want people back at work as soon as possible to minimize what will be the greatest acute labor crisis in history. A busy Walmart nearby closed a whole week for “cleaning”, but it’s likely because too many employees are out with Covid. Groceries, pharmacies, business, critical infrastructure , healthcare, everything is going to get hit HARD and FAST. 

Hospitals are fucking dying right now and the worst is yet to come.. My hospital has been diverting patient to other hospitals, which are also literally all on divert, therefore no one is on divert. We have the physical rooms but not the staff to cover the rooms. If we lose any more staff, dermatologists will start intubating and managing vents (but kind of actually). People will fucking die from lack of medical care. 

Do whatever you need to do to protect your assets or make a lot of 🌈🐻 money in this market. Don’t ask me what to do, my portfolio bleeds almost as much as my patients. 

TLDR: We are going to face the biggest and fastest labor shortage in history in the next 3-4 weeks

Side note: please don’t go to the hospital if you’re unless you’re in a high risk group or are short of breath. There’s nothing the hospital will do for you healthy young adults except stick you with a $3,000 bill unless you need oxygen. Call your doctor instead, though they’ll probably get Covid as well.

2.3M Total share float, 49.2M **shares are locked up until the stock trades above $12 dollars for 20 days out of a 30-day period**, 600 shares available to short at 26.8% interest. About 2 days left to return 1M shares. This will be a $12 stock minimum maybe not tomorrow, but I expect a minimum of $50 and squeezy sector of $150

**Technical Analysis**

Not a lot of data to chew on here since the recent de-spac, but I think we have found our floor around $6.00. If Fathom starts a squeeze I would expect a ride up into $10-$12, probably retest the $14 high. Long term if Fathom should trade to at least $30-50 like the floor of their competitors. If they start to take over the market share and acquire companies I think we see $75.

[Double bottom on the hourly chart](https://preview.redd.it/w1rlbmbavz981.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38153348d664c899b9d5d136c1e2250a1fe7ac4)

**Potential Catalysts**

Upcoming Needham Virtual Growth Conference 01/10/22. Baird Presentation below, should be similar to Needham.

**TL;DR**

2.3M share float, other shares locked up until at least $12. Close to bottom price, competitors trade at floors of $20+, Jan-Feb squeeze for sector could repeat. Buying up companies around new TSLA factory. Bad ass company doing bad ass things with bad ass people.

**Position**

Currently holding 1,000 shares @ $7.04 scaling in slowly. Looking for a full entry of $35k around $6.00-$6.50

6677,wallstreetbets,"PELOSI-LAND, EXPERIENCE THE CORRUPTION","  Anyone else fascinated about the combination of the recently released trades from Nancy Pelosi? There is something much bigger going on here than the run of the mill insider trading that we are used to seeing from her. Something big is brewing, and I think I have cracked the code. This will be a ground-breaking new experience, and we will all want to participate.

Imagine a full on, immersive virtual reality that will be up and running at Disney Land (her home state) in the near future. It will be powered by MU chips, managed by CRM software and put on blast on GOOG for the whole world to see. The possibilities will be limitless.

You could peruse the halls of Congress, taking in high level meetings, then promptly return to your office to day trade on the info you gleaned from your position. Or you could start a pissing match with Mitch Mcconnell and blame all the ills of the county on him and his constituents. Maybe you would rather give an orange man a condescending clap on national TV to show your disproval of everything about him. 

Those ideas not for you? How about calling the CEO’s of (insert industry here) to a nationally televised dog and pony show where you berate them and grandstand about how horrible their companies are to the country. Afterwards, you can contact the above-mentioned CEO’s and let them know that their problems can disappear with the proper campaign donations. 

Still not your cup of tea? Then maybe you can help pass legislation written by corporate lobbyists in exchange for guarantees of lucrative “consulting” gigs when you time in “public service” is up. Or be at the helm as all types of crimes are just ignored and not prosecuted in the name of criminal justice reform, turning a once thriving city into a cesspool of tweakers, thieves and all around homeless degenerates. 

You could mandate strict lockdowns and mask wearing for the people, then turn around and go to your favorite salon maskless, since these rules obviously don’t apply to someone of your stature. Or my personal favorite: Rubbing shoulders with titans of government and industry, laughing about how the dumb “poors” actually believe that you are trying to pass policies that will benefit them, when the only benefit you are trying to achieve is growing your own wealth and power.

There are countless other possibilities that I can’t even fathom that could give you the true experience of being one of the most powerful and well-connected politicians in the world, brought to life in this new Pelosi-Land omniverse. The moto of this fantastic place would obviously be “Pelosi-Land, A place where corruption knows no bounds!” I, for one, cant wait to book my tickets and experience this one in a life time opportunity.",1641442326

*Company Overview:*

$MMM – 3M Inc. is a global, diversified technology company that operates in the following businesses: Safety/Industrial, Transportation/Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. 3M develops their products in -house, and thus has an unusually high product development, and research and development costs.

3M operates in 4 main business segments, which include: Safety/Industrial, Transportation/Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. These business segments appear on some of their quarterly and annual financial reports, and their performance in each of these segments will be discussed later.

***Investment Information:***

*Competitors:*

In order to undergo the comparable analysis, we need to get an idea of their closest competitors. These competitors must operate in the same space, operate in similar geographies, be of similar market cap, and have valid financial ratios. Using this criterion, I cam up with the following.

· **$HON – Honeywell International:** Honeywell International.is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. Its Aerospace segment offers several electronics, software, physical parts, and power units to their clientele in the aviation business. Honeywell’s Building Technologies segment offers applications software, switches, and electronics that assist in the building and construction industries.

The company's Safety and Productivity Solutions segment provides personal protection equipment, apparel; cloud-based notification/emergency messaging; software solutions; and custom-engineered sensors.

· **$GE – General Electric:** General Electric operates as a high-tech industrial company. The company's Power segment offers gas turbines for utilities, power producers, and industrial applications; steam power technology (boilers, generators etc.); and reactor technologies. This segment services may industries, such as marine, oil and gas, mining, rail, metals, test systems, and water. GE’s Renewable Energy segment provides various solutions for onshore and offshore wind, blades, hydro, storage, solar, and grid solutions, and hybrid renewables. The company's Aviation segment designs/produces commercial and military aircraft engines, integrated engine components, electric power, and mechanical aircraft systems; and provides aftermarket services.

*Financial Information:*

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, 3M’s net sales essentially remained constant, however, they were able to decrease their operating expense by 3.6%, which helped to contribute to a higher operating income and a higher operating margin. Additionally, 3M was able to increase their net income in 2020 by 18% which is very high, and their EPS ended the year at $9.32 (up from 2019’s EPS of $7.92).

· **Yearly Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, 3M’s Transportation and Electronic segment’s revenues decreased by 8% and represents their only declining segment. However, within these segments the Abrasives, Advanced Materials, Aerospace, and Oral Care performed the worst, declining 15%, 17%, 16%, and 19% respectively.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Good):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net income by 0.3%, which might not sound good, however, considering 3M’s operating income decreased in this time period any increase in net income is great. Furthermore, 3M was able to keep their EPS (basic and diluted) constant during this time, which is again good considering their decline in operating income.

· **Q3 2021 Financial Performance (Bad):** In Q3 2021, 3M increased their net sales by 7% YoY, now you may be wondering “how is this bad”? Well, during this same period, 3M increased their operating expenses by 11%, which contributes to a lower operating margin. This can be seen by their YoY decline in operating income of 6%

· **Share Repurchasing:** In the first 3 quarters of 2021 (Jan 1 – September 30th), 3M reported repurchasing 6,675,484 at an average cost basis of $190.88/share (totalling $1.27B worth of shares repurchased). This would have increased the value of existing shares by approximately 1.2%, which is a great sign for longer term investors.

***Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses: (Spreadsheet found at the end of this analysis)*

By comparing 3M’s financial ratios to that of their publicly listed competition (listed above in the “competitors” section) I found the following:

*PE Ratio:*

Based off of 3M’s Price to Earnings Ratio in comparison to their competitors, $MMM should be valued at $232.72/share, which would imply a share price increase of 29%. This is a little high, so I decided to take another comparable.

*P/B Ratio:*

3M’s P/B ratio (compared to their counterparts) indicates that their fair value is $143.52/share, which would translate into a downside risk of 20%. This is a little low and contradicts the results achieved via the P/E comparable.

*EV/Revenue Ratio:*

3M’s EV/Revenue ratio indicates that their fair value is $174.82/share, which would translate into a small downside of 3%. This is the most realistic estimate of the 3 comparable analyses, however I decided to take the average of the three comparable analyses to have one comparable price target.

*Comparable Valuation:*

Based off of the above comparable analyses, I landed on one final (comparable) valuation of $183.69/share, which would imply an increase of 2%. This indicates that 3M is very close to their fair value.

*DCF: (Visualization found at the end of this analysis)*

By inputting the necessary data into my DCF model, it arrived at a fair valuation of $MMM stock of $205/share, which implies a potential upside to this investment of 14%. This is pretty close to the result as achieved in my comparable valuation, which indicates that 3M is sitting at/around their fair value and has a little bit of room to run up.

*Dividend Discount Model: (Visual at the end of this analysis)*

My dividend discount model uses the current annual dividend amount in combination with 3M’s average annual dividend growth (over the past 4 years), and their WACC (as found in the DCF model). By using these metrics, I was able to find 3M’s fair value to be $203/share, which implies an upside of 13%. Once again this is very close to their current fair value, which indicates that 3M is a decent buy.

*Overall Valuation:*

In order to provide simplicity, I wanted to come to one final, all-encompassing valuation for the $MMM stock. I did this through taking the average valuation of the Average Comparable, the DCF, and the Dividend Discount Model. By doing this I arrived at a price target for the $MMM stock of $197/share, which implies an upside of 9.5%.

***Investment Plan:***

My plan for an investment in the $MMM stock would go as follows:

· Enter into a position below the fair value, preferably at/below $180/share.

· Hold long-term (with dividend re-investment)

· Re-evaluate the position as new data is released (especially the 10-Q (quarterly) and 10-K (annual) reports).

***Risks:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, and Q3 2021, there were a few concerning metrics that arose from their financial statements. These include their cost of good sold out-pacing their revenue growth (means margins are shrinking). If these trends continue, it could invalidate my DCF model, and their fair value would be lower than I estimated.

***Catalysts:***

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020 and Q3 of 2021, 3M reported decent earnings, but there are still areas to improve upon in order to attract more investors, and potentially increase the share price. Firstly, their net income has been steadily increasing (which is good), despite their operating income either increasing or decreasing. If they can find a way to keep their operating income to consistently grow,, translating in higher increases in their net incomes this would be good.

· **Share Repurchasing:** Over the past couple of years, 3M has been repurchasing more shares than they have been issuing. This is a very good trend for investors to note, as every year their shares represent a larger stake in their company. These repurchases help investors to return more on their invested capital",1641441319

There is something much bigger going on here than the run of the mill insider trading that we are used to seeing from her. Something big is brewing, and I think I have cracked the code. This will be a ground-breaking new experience, and we will all want to participate.

Imagine a full on, immersive virtual reality that will be up and running at Disney Land (her home state) in the near future. It will be powered by MU chips, managed by CRM software and put on blast on GOOG for the whole world to see. The possibilities will be limitless.

You could peruse the halls of Congress, taking in high level meetings, then promptly return to your office to day trade on the info you gleaned from your position. Or you could start a pissing match with Mitch Mcconnell and blame all the ills of the county on him and his constituents. Maybe you would rather give an orange man a condescending clap on national TV to show your disproval of everything about him. 

Those ideas not for you? How about calling the CEO’s of (insert industry here) to a nationally televised dog and pony show where you berate them and grandstand about how horrible their companies are to the country. Afterwards, you can contact the above-mentioned CEO’s and let them know that their problems can disappear with the proper campaign donations. 

Still not your cup of tea? Then maybe you can help pass legislation written by corporate lobbyists in exchange for guarantees of lucrative “consulting” gigs when you time in “public service” is up. Or be at the helm as all types of crimes are just ignored and not prosecuted in the name of criminal justice reform, turning a once thriving city into a cesspool of tweakers, thieves and all around homeless degenerates. 

You could mandate strict lockdowns and mask wearing for the people, then turn around and go to your favorite salon maskless, since these rules obviously don’t apply to someone of your stature. Or my personal favorite: Rubbing shoulders with titans of government and industry, laughing about how the dumb “poors” actually believe that you are trying to pass policies that will benefit them, when the only benefit you are trying to achieve is growing your own wealth and power.

There are countless other possibilities that I can’t even fathom that could give you the true experience of being one of the most powerful and well-connected politicians in the world, brought to life in this new Pelosi-Land omniverse. The moto of this fantastic place would obviously be “Pelosi-Land, A place where corruption knows no bounds!” I, for one, cant wait to book my tickets and experience this one in a life time opportunity.",1641439644

6723,wallstreetbets,All the reasons SPY will see 455-460 before it sees 480+ again,"Welcome to my ted talk... cue the gay bear comments. 

Okay now retards listen up. 

Today we finally saw the dip we were looking for to confirm that SPY will (most likely) see a large dip before we reach ATH again.

Todays dip brought the price down to close at 468.38. Why is that important? Well throughout these dips this week the stock always managed to recover and close above the 5 day EMA and the 20 day EMA... until today. 

This closed the candle below the 20 day EMA of 470.4... historically looking back whenever SPY closed a candle below the 20 day it usually bounces near the 100 day EMA which is 455.2

The same applies to the daily bollinger bands. We had been bouncing off the mid bollinger and closing above it until today. We saw a close below the kid bollinger of 469.81... in general the price usually finds support near the lower bollinger band which is also near 457.15

Daily RSI is in a downward trend and the daily MACD is going to cross over to sell very soon. 

All of this brings me to the conclusion we will see 455 very soon... it should also be noted that there is a support line that perfectly runs along 455 which we saw SPY bounce off on 12/20/21, 10/6/21, 10/4/22, 10/30/2020, and 5/4/2020... yes this support line is almost a year and a half old. 

I am anticipating a sideways/ slight recovery and rest day tomorrow that should see a retest and rejection near that 20 day EMA before we close our 2nd candle below it.",1641438614

Steps to print money:
1. Pick any stock ideally one that has a lower chance of fluctuating 2% in the span of 15 mins
2. Buy 9:30
3. Set stop loss of 2%
4. Sell at 9:45 no matter what the price
5. Repeat every day

When you lose, you only lose 2%. When you gain, on avergae you will gain more than 2%. And since you will gain on 51% or greater of the days you will gain money guaranteed.

My gains.  

Associate Professor of Internal Medicine here. I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. Let’s not squander this opportunity.

**TLDR:** 

1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a drop in the price. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The price fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150-180 days from the date of the accusations depending on the manner of filing. Because the false assertions cratered the stock price, I believe when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic, then I anticipate price recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**
2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \*clinical\* data.**
3. &amp;#x200B;

**Math Class:**

Stock price’s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 77% after allegations

Thirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.

**Complete recovery means the price will Increase 432%, not 66%.**

&amp;#x200B;

**A quick recap of the data and stock runup:**

For this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial (both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer’s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA’s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the price went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull. 

Why did the market value the data at 5 billion? [ Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best: 

***""If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer's disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.""*** 

Put simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data’s significance, as Alzheimer's currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the price was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that’s when all the drama started, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster since.  

But before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam’s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm’s (another competitor) data thus far, is worse than Donanemab’s results.

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:** 

On August 2021, a short report was filed with the FDA (called a citizen’s petition) to halt further testing to protect patients. The claims, by Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt (more on them later), asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety; however, the report 70-page report and five supplements mentioned no significant adverse events. Here is the full [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) for your viewing pleasure. You might assume the price action signified the|accusations had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won’t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials (Facts). Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:

1) The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will halt trials. 

2) The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety. 

3) Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues. 

4) But Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses? The summary of the number of doses can be found [here](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam), and again here is the [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) filed by Pitt and Bredit.

5) Thus IMO, there is NO chance of the FDA halting trials.

I am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what Dr. Bredt and Dr. Pitt are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can’t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this ‘news.’ The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can't stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the price recovers leading up to the citizen’s petition dismissal. IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don’t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence.  Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but I’m probably not ;)).

**Need More Evidence?**

Below is a tweet essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a84qpth90z981.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1f1c56cd14553c388e56edd2567abcb10785a9d

You will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue (let's throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that's what the Adrain et al. are trying). A safety assessment was the entire point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under no circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3.

**Still More Evidence:**

On November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, ""there are no signs of data manipulation."" SAVA price increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations. 

**Remi The Diamond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Chief SAVAge):**

SAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It’s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.

[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cosyntex. Here is their insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:

 

https://preview.redd.it/eu4s6wkg0z981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196ed053083cae9e70a8e9bd583f78b84c9a24cf

Ready?  Okay, the data readout was “primary endpoints were not met” meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason. 

Now let’s look at SAVA:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yxisqrui0z981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2ee063b74d1266c778ff3760281d3f574e266cf

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)

SAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself.  **As Peter Lynch said, “Insiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.”** 

To reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won’t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. IMO, that date will be on/or before February 21st, 2022. In some instances, the FDA may respond by the deadline and say they are extending, but as long as the FDA does not halt trials SAVA is on its way to FDA approval. As discussed above, IMO, the sky will fall before the FDA halts trials.

**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**

There will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that's what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY's protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (March-ish). 

SAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.  

Other potential drivers of price action include:

* A SI of 40%. (ATH’s)
* A float of less than 40 million.
* A dedicated investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)

All this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.  

**I have more wrinkles than these degenerate smooth brains and rock-solid erections, so what do you have, Professor?**

[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)

Why did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western blot says (pre-clinical data). **The FDA will never ignore dying humans for western blots. The opposite is also true.** Simufilam’s CLINICAL data shows cognitive and behavioral improvement.  This is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why critics shift the narrative here: “[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).”

**Simufilam's data shows it is:** 

**1). Safe**

**2) Effective** 

**3) Desperately needed by Alzheimers patients.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Before shorts attack the integrity of the Cognition data:**

It was collected over sixteen clinical sites, across the US and Canada, by physician principal investigators and their associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. These clinical sites can be audited by the IRB at any time. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The sponsor (SAVA) maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded) which can be audited by the FDA at any time. CRA’s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way…

Long-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the price over 750-1000 within two years. Here is a full breakdown of TAM and why [SAVA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-sava-may-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity.) is so valuable. A common psychological phenomenon is a disbelief resulting in rejection of simple math. It’s simple math, so look it over with an open mind.

I must always share my favorite summary of how much the market values Alzheimer's treatment.  

***On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication, and the market cap increased by $17 billion in one day. Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).*** 

SAVA's market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point is, I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I’ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.

**House cleaning:**

I spared the details of the drama surrounding this stock, but to update those that follow me: our group of Scientist investors together we have written a 48-page research report on SAVA [here, ""A Comprehensive Stock Analysis""](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/cassava-sciences-sava-comprehensive-stock-analysis). 

The Authors include

Through my investing career, IMO, the first thing you will notice about successful investors is the amount of data they examine closely to see what others miss. Mr. Market's ""headline hysteria"" usually means buying opportunities for them (“overreaction with reversion to the mean”).

SAVA's YT presence had grown courtesy of the one and only OG Joe Springer (He was a bull when SAVA was $6).  

If you have dyslexia and prefer to watch (not read), please watch [ Dr. Boyers (Academic and Clinical Neurologist) discuss SAVA's medication with Joe Springer here](https://youtu.be/h55Rio8qhy8).

**Did I mention SAVA’s historical data and Alzheimer’s patients, families, physicians, and scientists have become a dedicated investor base rallying around the historical data? We are investors that will not sell unless the data changes.** 

With the allegations expiring and the CUNY investigation ending, our SAVAge group plans to start pitching to tutes.  

**Lastly:**

**The clinical data is historical and bulletproof, and I will not let this fact get lost.** There is no point in arguing. If you genuinely believe SAVA is a fraud and the FDA will halt trials, then place your (ill-informed losing) bets. What shorts and longs agree on is that SAVA does not know how to go sideways. It will either orbit Pluto or implode to $7 (cash price).  

Anyone with genuine questions or who believes my trusted experts and I missed something, I look forward to a civil discussion.

Hi everyone, bob here.

I posted this same data yesterday (with less detail) and have gotten a tidal wave of requests from fellow apes to repost for visibility, so here I am reposting an update to the update on FTDs because:

&amp;#x200B;

SAVAge Ape and Associate Professor of Internal Medicine here. I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. If you squander this opportunity, you deserve it.  

**TLDR:** 

1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a bear raid. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The stock price fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150-180 days from the date of the accusations depending on the manner of filing. Because the false assertions cratered the SP, I believe when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic, then I anticipate SP recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**
2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \*clinical\* data.** 
3. **A sincere scientist will not advocate for stopping research on safe and promising medication.**

**Math Class:**

Stock price ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 77% after allegations

Thirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.

**Complete recovery means the stock price will Increase 432%, not %.**

**A quick recap of the data and stock runup:**

For this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial (both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer’s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA’s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. At this time, the stock price went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull. 

Why did the market value the data at 5 billion? [ Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best: 

***""If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer's disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.""*** 

Put simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data’s significance, as Alzheimer's currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the stock price was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that’s when all the drama started, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster since.  

But before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam’s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm’s (another competitor) data thus far, is worse than Donanemab’s results.

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:** 

On August 2021, a short report was filed with the FDA (called a citizen’s petition) to halt further testing to protect patients. The bogus claims, by Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt (more on them later), asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety (the blatant disregard for patients is remarkable as there were NO safety issues, and halting research literally harms patients). Still, the stock collapsed. You might assume the price action signified the |accusations| (err slander) had merit or a chance of succeeding. 📷You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won’t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials (Facts). Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:

1) The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will halt trials. 

2) The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety. 

3) Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues. 

4) But Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses?

5) Thus IMO, there is NO chance of the FDA halting trials.

I am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what Dr. Bredt and Dr. Pitt are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can’t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this ‘news.’ The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can't stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the stock price recovers leading up to the citizen’s petition dismissal. IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don’t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence.  Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but I’m probably not ;)).

**Need More Evidence?**

Adrian has stated that he holds a short position and is vocal that SAVA is a fraud**.** Below he is essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed. Adrian posted this three days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

[IMO, Adrian is downplaying the importance of the principal governing authority of clinical trials.](https://preview.redd.it/1qksq5d2oy981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178adf2b21923aa876e953d1a356ee07a13c33d9)

You will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue (let's throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that's what the Adrain et al. are trying). A safety assessment was the entire point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under NO circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3. To say we need more data is valid, but to say stop testing the medication is beyond disingenuous. **A sincere scientist will not stop research on a safe medication, much less a safe drug with promising data.**

**Still More Evidence:**

On November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, ""there are no signs of data manipulation."" SAVA stock price increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations. 

**Remi The Diamond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Chief SAVAge):**

SAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It’s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.

[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cosyntex. Here is their insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uvvwvbi9oy981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1c2dd6e00c0299f97de2be713560442d147358d

Ready?  Okay, the data readout was “primary endpoints were not met” meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason. 

Now let’s look at SAVA:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ykvzrumboy981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37e41dff0f4b1294a04e84f00b3af6fd29aa2860

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)

SAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself.  **As Peter Lynch said, “Insiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.”** 

To reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won’t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. IMO, that date will be on/or before February 21st, 2022. In some instances, the FDA may respond by the deadline and say they are extending, but as long as the FDA does not halt trials SAVA is on its way to FDA approval. As discussed above, IMO, the sky will fall before the FDA halts trials.

**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**

There will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that's what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY's protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (March-ish). 

SAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.  

Other potential drivers of price action include:

* A float of less than 40 million.
* A dedicated investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)

All this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.

[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)

Why did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western blot says (pre-clinical data). **The FDA will never ignore dying humans for western blots. The opposite is also true.** Simufilam’s CLINICAL data shows cognitive and behavioral improvement.  This is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why critics shift the narrative here: “[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).”

**Simufilam's data shows it is:** 

**1). Safe**

**2) Effective** 

**3) Desperately needed by Alzheimers patients.** 

**Before shorts attack the integrity of the Cognition data:**

It was collected over sixteen clinical sites, across the US and Canada, by physician principal investigators and their associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The sponsor (SAVA) maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded). CRA’s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way…

Long-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the stock price over 750-1000 within two years. Here is a full breakdown of TAM and why [SAVA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-sava-may-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity.) is so valuable. A common psychological phenomenon is a disbelief resulting in rejection of simple math. It’s simple math, so look it over with an open mind.

I must always share my favorite summary of how much the market values Alzheimer's treatment.  

***On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication, and the market cap increased by $17 billion in one day. Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).*** 

SAVA's market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point is, I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I’ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.

**House cleaning:**

I spared the details of the drama surrounding this stock, but to update those that follow me: our group of Scientist investors together we have written a 48-page research report on SAVA [here, ""A Comprehensive Stock Analysis""](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/cassava-sciences-sava-comprehensive-stock-analysis). 

The Authors include

Clinical and Academic Neurologists, 

MDs, 

PhDs, 

PharmDs, 

Successful biotech investors 

An Chief Global Strategist and Healthcare Leader

When I say successful investors, I mean one investor worth over two and a half-billion dollars, [here, LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swapnil-agarwal-27071b11/). I myself have gained over 1900% (19x) over two years (yes even after the market crapped out in 2021). The first thing you will notice about successful investors is the amount of data we examine closely to see what others miss. Mr. Market's ""headline hysteria"" usually means buying opportunities for us (“overreaction with reversion to the mean”).

SAVA's YT presence had grown courtesy of the one and only OG Joe Springer (He was a bull when SAVA was $6).  

If you have dyslexia (like me) and prefer to watch (not read), please watch [ Dr. Boyers (Academic and Clinical Neurologist) discuss SAVA's medication with Joe Springer here](https://youtu.be/h55Rio8qhy8).

For those who don't care to go long or short, but want entertainment, read about the Short report authors. Both MD/Ph.Ds from Johns Hopkins. Pitt currently teaches future cardiologists at Cornell. This incredible resume belongs to men who thought it brilliant to use allegations against a childhood rape survivor. Bredt and Pitt state she lied about her rape decades ago as a child and so she is an untrustworthy employee at one of the clinical sites. These heinous repugnant attacks led [to longs filing a complaint with The NY Medical Board (where Pitt practices) here](https://youtu.be/r7EYpWBPz2Y) or read the actual complaint to the NY Medical Board [here](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:9b85cf89-a7ce-43f4-ba04-b7df01a0e41e). Or read his [colleague’s comment](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FDA-2021-P-0930-0211). All the degrees in the world cannot teach common sense and how not to be a giant asshole in Bredt and Pitt’s case.

**Did I mention SAVA’s historical data and Alzheimer’s patients, families, physicians, and scientists have become a dedicated investor base rallying around the historical data? We are investors that will not sell unless the data changes.** 

With the allegations expiring and the CUNY investigation ending, our SAVAge group plans to start pitching to tutes.  

**Lastly:**

**The clinical data is historical and bulletproof, and I will not let this fact get lost.** There is no point in arguing. If you genuinely believe SAVA is a fraud and the FDA will halt trials, then place your (ill-informed losing) bets. What shorts and longs agree on is that SAVA does not know how to go sideways. It will either orbit Pluto or implode to $7 (cash price).  

Anyone with genuine questions or who believes my trusted experts and I missed something, I look forward to a civil discussion.

If you didn't get out today, tomorrow is your next best chance.

Did you see how bad AMC, BBY, and GME fell today?

Well, many gay bears were hibernating and next week they'll be awake ready to eat your tendies. (You think Ken Griffin and his friends don't remember? Your tendies will now be his tendies, if you don't sell.)

I saw someone post that they lost over $40k today, but they also said they made $250k because of JPow.

It's nice to hear that they can still sell at a profit (maybe not so much after the tax man comes), but a profit is a profit thanks to JPow.

So he should sell so he can put the down payment on that house he always wanted and buy a Lexus to drive his wife in. 

We all deserve nice things, but you gotta sell to do it.

And you Tesla nerds, don't think I forgot about you.

Gay bears like feasting on the carcass of the smallest animals first. That's AMC. That's GME. 

But they're coming for your Tesla shares too. And then Tim Apple and Jeff Amazon for dessert.

All of your tendies taste sweet and we're hungry.

Now go and get some sleep, because tomorrow is your time to sell. (And go get a job while you're at it, since the money printer is off and your student loans won't be cancelled.)

I would also like to say, I have tried to use as many pictures as I can for easy processing, and I have tried to organize this the best I can, but it's a lot of data, and I'm 4 hours into this at the time of writing this, so I am sorry if it's a little messy sometimes.

I am a numbers person.  I don't like fluff, and hype.  I like facts, and results.  I'm a software engineer, I like logic, it's my world lens, and I'm here to share with you why I think GME has to be one of the best plays in the market, if not the best play right now.

I'll now explain why I'm going for June 130c's, 150c's, and why I am still bullish on GME in the medium term (6 months)

My TA is worthless without some explanation, so I have tried to label things as clearly as I can, to make this as easy to digest as possible, no fiber necessary ;)

The orange boxes represent the historical price ranges in the Jan -&gt; July window over the last 3 years.

The flags indicate the first trading day of the year, and July 17th, for each trading window

The yellow line is kind of like a candle within the orange box which I use to gauge my own expectations when charting.  This is a personal strategy, has little to do with the overall DD, but helps keep a frame of reference IMO.

Then, finally, the red boxes which are numbered.  These will be used as reference points to talk about GME, and their actions, and market sentiment for those trading windows.

My analysis of a company comes from actions that a company is taking to position themselves for the future, not where they are positioned today.  After all, you make money when you're early, not when you're late, and we all know hard hard it can be to time the market, especially as options traders, it's a core element of what we do, or try to do.

Ahhhhh  yes, 2019, covid isn't here yet, the world is running as it was designed to, and GME is a dying brick and motor company being led by an experienced brick and motor CEO, and executives, trying to survive in the gaming industry, arguably, one of the most technologically adoptive industries in the market.  The CEO decided to direct the company into primary collectables, and used hardware, and disks.  Essentially, a death sentence for the company.  It's clearly on a downtrend, since the retail sentiment, along with the wall street sentiment is that the company won't survive for 5 more years.

* **Game sales are primary digital** at this point.
* GameStop **has sizable debt** at this point.
* Their revenues, and sales, are clearly, and **rapidly declining**.
* The **leadership** constantly shouting 'multi-channel e-commerce business' as if that means anything anymore.
* GameStop looks like it's on the fast track to zero, as it should be based on it's **future market positioning**, and **leadership**.

At this point, GME has been shorted into oblivion, both by wallstreet, and retail, it's just not looking good for the company, anyone here could agree with that, except for maybe DFV, and other early GME bulls, but even they'd say it's risky at this point, and it might not work out.

This is just used as an example to show where the company was 2 years ago, which has significant influence when you're trying to gauge how fast a company can turn around, and make shifts in an industry.  We'd all be able to agree that 2019 GME, and 2021 GME are different beasts, although, with some of the same existing problems, which I'll touch on later.

**#2 (part 1), The Burrrrrry Chapter**

This is an interesting one, since there is a pretty significant spike in the share price, followed by a meltdown to previous levels.  There wasn't any news regarding GME actions at this time, however, there was an activist hedge fund who was invested into the company at the time, Scion Capital, which is managed by Michael Burrrrrrry.  From here, things get interesting, I'll try to use as many pictures as I can to keep your attention.

Lets start with the SEC filing for the purchase Scion Capital made of 3.4 million GME shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001649339\/000090514820000491\/efc20-335\_sc13d.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/hujye2if3y981.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68ebfa57e8e8c18a0af688fd8eb5b8e48844c210)

Then, prior to the filing, Mr. Burrrrry wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors, which I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** reading, sorry if the screenshots are too small, CBA to enlarge the page, source is included in the caption.

**Part 1:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Just goes to show the INSANE short conviction, which later detailed by the proof of naked shorts by the SEC is not shocking since the only way out is to admit to illegal activity for SHF, and market makers involved.](https://preview.redd.it/ltk4re5m3y981.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ec24a6a205a419a59cde870a39f666daa2e0c6)

As you can see by the dates I have highlighted above, Michael Burry suggested to GameStop that they are heavily, and unreasonably sold short, since they have more cash on-hand publicly than their company is even being valued at.  This is a huge red-flag for a term called '[death spiral financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_spiral_financing)'.  Michael Burry caught it in the very early phases by pointing out that they had debt accruing, and enough money to pay it off, while also doing a share buyback, and expressed concern that the company leadership had chosen to not take that action yet.  He also suggested to combat the overwhelming short interest that was building on GME.  This is extremely evident looking back due to data given by the SEC GameStop investigation/report that was published (see image below), along with Michael Burrys own provided data in his letter.

This is a big part of what led to the **January 2021 sneeze**.

As you can see, the 13D filing Michael Burrrrry filed is dated 'April 2nd, 2019', which directly correlates to the graph, as the spike here starts on April 3rd, **the day after the letter was delivered to the GME leadership**, and brings the stock price from $2.67 at the low on April 9th, to the peak of $6.40 on April 14th.  This is the time-frame where Scion capital made it's GME purchase of 3.4 million shares.

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 (part 2) The Ryan Cohen Chapter (this happened between #2, and #3 on my graph)**

Quick backstory on RC before we move on:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ryan\_Cohen ](https://preview.redd.it/tkpbuc4s2y981.png?width=2145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c1929451cff13da12e1303068d3eb9044d061f7)

Long story short, he took a company from round 1 VC funding in 2013 @ 15 million, to selling the company in 2017 for $3.35 billion, which was the largest e-commerce acquisition of all time.  That's a 4 year timeline from nothing to billions.  Innovative, disruptive, and efficient.

Between #2, and #3 on my chart, RC made his initial purchases of GME shares, which he filed in his 13D filing of his investment company, RC Ventures LLC, which was a total of 5.8 million shares, pictured below.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/fintel.io\/doc\/sec-gme-gamestop-rc-ventures-llc-sc-13d-2020-august-28-18502 \(scroll to bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/w8eu9ddt2y981.png?width=1903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ba1f9e8845017ade3cf6de72cc361dedfb9e71)

RC made 6 purchases, the first being over 5% of the company, which required him to file a 13D, and the rest being adding to that position, which required a 13D/A, essentially adding to a position greater than 5% of the outstanding shares of a company, used for almost all hostile takeovers.  You will see the green boom boom candles between #2, and #3 directly correlate to the days that these filings are created.

&amp;#x200B;

[httpsL\/\/fintel.io\/if\/rc-ventures-llc](https://preview.redd.it/l79unusp3y981.png?width=1864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c24aff60f6085ff245b32821faa75724ec3ef11)

RC wrote a letter to the GameStop Board of Directors as well, saying to follow a new direction of becoming a tech company, allowing digital trade-ins, and a customer first approach.  I **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** reading this, since it's from the single largest shareholder of GME since Jan 1st, 2021, a man who turned $15M into $3.35B in a mere 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 The Sneeze, the Awakening, DFV, and You**

This is the part of the graph that I feel needs no explanation really, that is, if you were here a year ago.  We were jacked on Tesla, and GME.  DFV finally was popular after about a year of his bleeding calls posts, and was in the green, thanks to Michael Burry, Ryan Cohen, and his own understanding of where this company was going, and the relentless SI.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Roaring Kitty](https://preview.redd.it/0bef8zqq3y981.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26600e067e3e502dee663586ffca6c94dd58919)

We here, on WSB, love options plays, especially options plays that have a lot of research.  A lot of analytical background, and that were drawn up with crayons, and memes.

While #2 was happening, WSB was growing, and GME was one of the most talked about stocks, both in a positive, and negative lights here.  Lots of people got their stimulus checks, and also were on Reddit, and for some reason, those wonderful retards that WSB was a place for good investment advice, bless their souls, they didn't know better at the time, hell, some still don't.

WSB grew from 2 million users, to 10 million users in the time-span between #2, and #3.  If you were here for that, you know it was chaos, and you probably remember the talks of 'the end of the OG WSB'.  In a lot of ways, that was very accurate, and in other ways, it was less accurate, WSB has evolved, for sure, lots of meaningless DD flared posts, shills, and way more retards playing FD's than ever.  Just look at the TSLA posts this last week, and you'll see that there is still an embodiment of what WSB stands for.

I'm getting sentimental, so I'll leave it there, just know, I love you retards.

**Adding Up The Facts**

Michael Burry pointed out in his letter that there was an insane amount of SI, and that more shares were trading for GME at the time, than shares that should be possible to trade, IE, 'naked shorts'.  The SEC confirmed this for us earlier this year with their GameStop investigation:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/20545ass3y981.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdb4210c2853825f80d77c12441870af60de5df)

On December 31st, 2020, GME had more than 100% short interest confirmed by the SEC, AKA, naked shorts.  To clarify, this means that without a shadow of a doubt, not a \*\*NOT A SINGLE SHARE WAS AVAILABLE\*\* to be sold long on the day December 31st, 2020, in a fair, and free market.  The SEC also confirms in this investigation that the shorts didn't close during the January run-up, they diamond handed, and hoped for the best, a feeling many of us know all too well.

This now brings us to January 3rd, 2021, WSB is growing massively, most people just barely got their stimulus in the mail/direct deposited, and are ready to throw it into the wall street casino.  They do what the average retard would do, buy some shares, and OTM weeklies/monthlies based on DD that was posted by some internet stranger (this time it's me, what's up), and knowing that there are \*\*ZERO SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GME AS OF THE LAST FRIDAY\*\*,  this puts extreme pressure on brokers, since they can't locate the shares.  They can't internalize.  They are fucked, market makers are fucked, SHF are fucked, and the DTCC + NSCC are freaking out.  They internally agree to turn off the buy button across a series of clearing houses, which forces brokers to turn their buy buttons off.

RH got the wrist slap from this, but don't forget, Webull, Public, T212, and many others also turned the buy button off.  This is because they got direct orders from Apex Clearing that they cannot process buy orders.  This requires some of the small SHF to buy-back shares from us, WSB.  We gave them the biggest, dirtiest middle finger we could.  We essentially took down Melvin Capital, P72, Citron, and many others.

We were all fucked by the buy button being turned off, since the majority of us had calls, which expire worthless if not exercised, and not enough money to exercise.  Many made money, more lost money, SHF's got bailed out by Citadel, their market maker, and partner in crime, and supposedly, life was supposed to keep going as if nothing happened?

Fuck no, we diamond handed that shit, at least many of us did.  We had been talking on WSB about the possible squeeze for MONTHS.  We're not going out without a fight, we doubled the fuck down, tripled down, diamond handed, exercised OTM calls, and did everything we could to put as much pressure as we could on those that took everything from us in 2008, 1970, etc.  We finally had the ace, they were wrong, we won.

The NSCC, and DTCC waived all fees, and SHF, and Citadel created massive can kicked positions to deal with the volume that they didn't have on-hand.  They bent the rules, and tried to force us out.  Looking at the graph again, this is the best part.

**#3, and #4 We're Still Here, and The Shorts Are Still There:**

There's clearly apes here, GameStop sold 5m shares into the market to raise $1.7B  in cash, there's still practically no float (which we can prove without a doubt now, thanks to GameStop filing their latest quarterly report), and shorts still are in the play, naked, or not.  They stated that there was 5M shares registered with CS as of Oct. 30st, 2021.  This was over a quarter ago, and here is the data gathered by apes since then.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.computershared.net ](https://preview.redd.it/505q558u3y981.png?width=2097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87cbc508575c13fd4caa2cbc92a3b45367526d2d)

According to this graph, as of today, we are sitting at close to 8M shares completely locked away just from certain subs, which I'm not sure I'm allowed to mention here, so I won't, but lets be honest, you know what they are.

This, in addition to RC's 9,001,000 shares, insiders additional \~5,700,000 shares, Institutional ownership of \~10,000,000  shares, mutual funds owning \~8,000,000 shares, and ETFs holding \~6,700,000 shares, that leaves us with a mere \~28,282,228 shares remaining.

This math visualized:

This data as you can see above, is likely about 3-5% higher for DRS'd shares than reality based on GameStops own report, which is detailed on the graph figure above.

**I hit the picture limit of reddit apparently, if you were wondering, it's 20**

So, I'll describe the rest the best I can, on the open see, there are 600,000-ish active users on a good month, and 280,000 on a bad month.  This gives them a **$13 billion dollar evaluation**.  GameStop is entering that space, rapidly, and efficiently, with premier partners, and their primary goal, with RC at the helm, is to delight customers.

GameStop, according to the letter RC wrote to the Board of Directors directly details that they have **55 million active subscriptions to their PowerUps program**.  If even **1%** of those users opt to try the new marketplace that GameStop is building, then GameStop will be a massive force to be reckoned with, short squeeze or no short squeeze.

**I think there is a short squeeze on the table still**, with GameStop hitting it's **lowest point in nearly a year today**, tons of shares locked away, and **11.4M WSB subscribers**, all it would take to repeat January 28th, 2021, is about **2 shares each, or $260**.  I remember when I saw people buying them by the hundreds, and many of us buying them at twice that for a single share.  I'm sure you love a home run, but I love to knock it out of the park with full bases, which is what we're looking at.  As of today, GameStop publicly reports **13.4%** short interest, and VW had a squeeze in 2008 which made it the **MOST VALUABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD** with only **12.8%** short interest.

So, from here, all I have left to say is see you on the moon when the tendiman comes.

6899,wallstreetbets,GME X COVID DD,"Ok retards, I fucking love graphs and upon studying the Ireland Covid Cases chart all 3 wrinkles activated and made a connection. The Gamestop sneeze that occured in january last year coincided with a sharp rise in Irish covid cases. See below:

Gamestops closing price peaked 27th jan. Maths is tricky here so try pay attention.

 27 - 10.

Thats a 18 day difference. So here my wrinkle brain started formulating and came up with a conclusion many hours later. 

Gamestops price has a 18 day delay to Irish covid cases.   

Now looking at modern day:

6962,wallstreetbets,Short DD on Semler Scientific ($SMLR),"Ever been to the doctor and had this inflatable thingie put around your arm? That is, apparently, how they try to determine whether your arteries are clogging with fat, and whether you are at risk for a myriad of severe conditions such as heart attacks. 

This company found a better, cheaper and quicker way; a clasp on your finger and on your toe, to measure it with electric impulses (or other magic). You’ll find Quora topics on it, with people recommending the service to each other(‘s grandmother). 

[Pure pleasure, apparently](https://preview.redd.it/fs89o5fdtx981.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d6cccc2d007f233f39f52dcb86a5ccb42b9c285)

It is a new, non-intrusive method, and they make money by charging a flat monthly fee and a fee-per-test. When a physician uses QuantoFlo, (s)he gets charged. Investors got their tits jacked after SMLR got uplisted from OTCQB to Nasdaq recently and with the company beating increasingly ambitious EPS targets ten times in a row. 

Then .. drama!

During the 1 Nov earnings call, they:

* Missed earnings at $14 instead of $15 million, 
* Missed EPS targets set by 3 (?) analysts by $0.19 per share, only reaching a net income of $0.51 per share, 
* Their gross profit margin went down from 92 to 90%, 
* They always said that their increase in operational costs will always be outpaced by their increase in revenue and that didn’t happen this time.

The stock price went from a close price of $149 to $111 in one day, and keeps trailing down, now at around $88. Why? Because they have a large P/E for their sector. Investors paid a premium expecting revenues to explode. Only 2 million Americans got tested and 80 million are guesstimated to be at risk. Hamburgers. 

When that didn’t happen a single time, they got spooked.

[Oops ..](https://preview.redd.it/7s7p4cl6tx981.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3ae8a24ec32a71d35b3881044ad72faab385563)

**So what about it?**

I suggest listening to the earnings call. The CEO/CFO said that Omicron caused the variable income based on fee-per-test - so not the flat rate fees - to go down and/or ‘some kind of yet to be determined seasonality’. Revenue will nonetheless continue to go up YoY.

It is not hard to imagine that physicians had other priorities with the Omicron variant in full effect. Same thing happened for this company in 2020, before things picked up again in 2021 after the vaccine.

During this call, it was also announced that the company bought stakes in various private firms to bring to market more healthcare related products in different HCC code categories, meaning an even larger potential to increase revenue with new patients targeted. 

People smarter than me crunched the numbers and investment fund Opaleye Management bought in at $114 *after the crash*. For me the immediate upside, after a solid earnings call at the end of February is somewhere north of that figure. Give it some time, and it might bounce back to $149 and above.

The short float is about 1.65%, which makes me believe that the market does not think this will drop much further. 

Company has no debt and has a cash position of $35.9 million at 9/30/2021 vs. $22.1 million at the end of 2020. In the earnings call it was said that dilution is not in the cards.

**Catalysts?**

Earnings call in the first half of 2022, as these PAD tests are expected to be conducted sooner rather than later. Management noted that the healthcare offices don't want to be caught in the same position they were caught in 2020, where they were conducting tests moderately until everything shut down.

An announcement of the other products/services, as this is currently still on the hush-hush. The news that they already signed a first customer to a license for one of these new products got completely buried. 

**The bear case?** 

The P/E is still high at 32.1x after the drop, and there was insider selling by the CEO, just before the earnings call at the end of October. He unloaded 5000 shares for about $670.000.

\*

\* \*

TL;DR: This stock is not talked about on Reddit yet, and has an immediate upside of about 24% and 62% in the mid-term. Or I am an idiot, who is to say?

6963,wallstreetbets,$GOEV Sitting well below moving averages - Crayon Eater Analysis,"Afternoon, apes!

It's me, the resident $GOEV pumper.

After the November spike the share price of our wonderful bangbus manufactuer has been beaten into the ground, and all indicators point to a good entry price.

The best fit curves I can find are 14, 50, 75, and 100-day moving averages, as pictured below:

https://preview.redd.it/9z9agvv6mx981.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb1c9722cc626a40a6c2cd37cf5e57952bb2255

$GOEV is  a highly volatile stock with lots of short-selling that sees long declines in share price, then gaps upward quickly before starting the trend again.

Our turnaround prices in the past 10 months have been \~$7.15 and \~$6.50, with our all-time low around $5.80.

**Share Price Currently Sits @ $7.29, while moving averages indicate support for a run up to around $8-10.**

# The Play

* 1/14, 1/21, 1/28, $7.50c, $8c, $8.50c
* 1/28-2/18, basically any strike price under $10

Upcoming catalyst-  we should expect a Q4 2021 update on either 2/14 or 2/21.  I'll probably buy some 2/18s just on the hope that we get the call on the 14th and more good news.

My positions: 

* 1200 heavy shares.  I'm long GOEV and continue to average down.  I will be buying more shares while it's under $8.
* I will be putting out orders for 1/21, 1/28, and 2/18 targeting $7.50 and $8, but I may get some $9 or $10 if they're cheap enough.",1641418381

7025,wallstreetbets,Interest Rates! Inflation! Jpow! BullFuck! Clickbate!,"By now we should all be experts at realizing how powerful the fed is. Especially proven by the declines today (which will continue, slowly). 

And with Inflation flying, job growth is booming, GDP for the most part hitting its targets, and JPOW looking like he has aged 40 years.

We can assume that jpow is officially and finally losing access to his money printer. (bears are in control). 

These should all be things you guys understand, no real big brain shit. 

However, How to make money off this is what separates the Retards from the Autists.  

I By no means have a crystal ball, but i would like to point out a few things that everyone should be thinking about when it comes to trying to make money in in 2022. 

1. Companies that live off of cheap debt are going to be crushed, examples: Doordash, and real estate companies - Zillow, and Blackstone. 
2. Banks are being handed a gift here, higher interest rates means banks can charge more in closing fees. Long WFC, BAC, MTB (they'll become for profitable, Revenues may reduce) 
3. Interest rates are rising, Which really means bond prices are falling. TYO, TTT and other short US treasury Etfs will absolutely kill it. 
4. Although all stock will likely take hits, Companies like MSFT, T, FB and other monsters that have taken out cheap loans in 2021 to repurchase stock in 2022 will likely fare better than the rest. (TSLA, NFLX are not a monster in this way.)  
5. Its also my opinion that 2022 will be the year the fundamentals start to actually matter again as money becomes more scarce. TXRH is a $72 stock max.

7093,wallstreetbets,The VCs are all making money on Heliogen (HLGN) and it's time we did too (by shorting it),"# Summary

Heliogen (HLGN) got a solid pump on ticker change when it deSPACed to HLGN; the float was understood to be \~2.3M shares, turns out that understanding was wrong.

Below I will basically try to summarize what EggPlatypus compiled on Twitter; his original post is there, the relevant S-4 filing is [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001840292/000121390021060916/fs42021a4_athenatechno.htm). You’d probably be better off reading his thread.

The actual float is &gt;2000% higher than that 2.3M figure that was touted. Total shares are 202.5M, insider shares are 154.5M, 108.6M are subject to lockup, leaving 45.8M shares which are all registered and tradeable as of last Friday. ^(\[S-4/A) ^(filing, page 21\])

Okay, so the low-float pump didn’t totally come to be, but that doesn’t mean a dump does it?

Yah obviously I mean look at the chart lol. There might be more dump though, which is exactly what we want.

&amp;#x200B;

# Nuts and bolts

In June 2021 HLGN closed a $83.4M round on a $750M valuation, at $10 those investors get 145% return, and only $27.7M of that $83.4M is locked up. ^(\[see page 268 and 272 of the S-4 filing\]) They will probably be taking profits on a risky play like this: SPAC with bloated valuation based on projected revenues five years from now.

In December 2020 they received a second Series A round at a $80M valuation; that round accounts for 19M shares, ^(\[see page 106 of the S-4 filing\]) all of those shares are available to sell and offer just those investors over 7x return (@$10/sh). They’re likely selling too.

HLGN is also in bad shape, they have $41.6M in cash, ^(\[see page 243 of the S-4 filing\]) but have significant cash burn projected for the next two years ($385M), ^(\[see page 149 of the S-4 filing\]) they received $188M from the SPAC, but still need an additional $155M which they will likely raise by selling hella shares.

&amp;#x200B;

# Additional mechanics at play

There are two dynamics that can make this drop juicier.

The first is, as shares become available PIPE investors will be able to go short to protect their downside in their position.

There is another element to this. We’re all probably familiar with the delta hedging mechanic by now, basically the tail wags the dog. OTM options buying drives option sellers to hedge to avoid taking a position on the underlying security.

If people are piling into OTM calls, MMs will have to buy shares; likewise, if people are piling into OTM puts, MMs will have to sell shares -- exacerbating the situation. Hopefully what you get is a parabolic move. I’m hoping for a parabolic move downwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, everything this guy touches allegedly turns to fucking shit including his marriage.

Last but not least [he used to sleep with his shoes on to save time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcsgZ122jrA). Not allegedly, there is [no doubt](https://i.imgur.com/fFFU2MD.png) in my mind that he did this, a #hustle-page post is all the DD I need.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

Long story short, HLGN may continue to dump and we can benefit:

* It got pumped because it was low float, actually it is high float and the float will continue to increase.
* Insiders will sell because their returns are already so good and the company will sell because they need money badly.
* Put buyers might cause MMs to delta hedge and create a parabolic move
* Bill Gates is like king midas if everything king midas touched was shit. He invested early and I allege that he wants to leave the retail investor with a big bag o shit

7094,wallstreetbets,Undervalued Stock $GS,"I know, I know.  Someone is recommending a bank/financial services company.  Before you downvote, here is why I'm optimistic and think Goldman Sachs is undervalued:

1) As interest rates rise, banks make more money.  Interest rates are rising.

2) GS is rolling in the cash. Q3 Earnings, $5.3 BILLION.  Even better is the revenue comes from many different areas, all of which seem to be growing. The biggest risk to growth is that investment banking slows down with fewer IPO's possibly in 2022.

3) Solid dividend, huge buybacks of shares.  $2.00 per quarter dividend, and $1 billion in share purchases just in last quarter.  I think buybacks will accelerate now that we are past the worst of covid and the gov isn't holding them back.

4) As boomers retire, they will need someone to manage their money.  Their current assets under management are $2.37 TRILLION!

5) They are helping other company's do Advanced Share Repurchases. Just search on google for stock buyback, and it seems like GS is financing everyone's purchases.  I don't know how much they make from this, but even a few points and it adds up!

6) P/E is 6.5.  Compared to so much else on the market, this is an amazing value play.

Not a financial advisor, please do your own due diligence.

7102,wallstreetbets,The VCs are all making money on Heliogen (HLGN) and it's time we did too (by shorting it),"# Summary

Heliogen (HLGN) got a solid pump on ticker change when it deSPACed to HLGN; the float was understood to be \~2.3M shares, turns out that understanding was wrong.

Below I will basically try to summarize what EggPlatypus compiled on Twitter; his original post is there, the relevant S-4 filing is [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001840292/000121390021060916/fs42021a4_athenatechno.htm). You’d probably be better off reading his thread.

The actual float is &gt;2000% higher than that 2.3M figure that was touted. Total shares are 202.5M, insider shares are 154.5M, 108.6M are subject to lockup, leaving 45.8M shares which are all registered and tradeable as of last Friday. ^(\[S-4/A) ^(filing, page 21\])

Okay, so the low-float pump didn’t totally come to be, but that doesn’t mean a dump does it?

Yah obviously I mean look at the chart lol. There might be more dump though, which is exactly what we want.

&amp;#x200B;

# Nuts and bolts

In June 2021 HLGN closed a $83.4M round on a $750M valuation, at $10 those investors get 145% return, and only $27.7M of that $83.4M is locked up. ^(\[see page 268 and 272 of the S-4 filing\]) They will probably be taking profits on a risky play like this: SPAC with bloated valuation based on projected revenues five years from now.

In December 2020 they received a second Series A round at a $80M valuation; that round accounts for 19M shares, ^(\[see page 106 of the S-4 filing\]) all of those shares are available to sell and offer just those investors over 7x return (@$10/sh). They’re likely selling too.

HLGN is also in bad shape, they have $41.6M in cash, ^(\[see page 243 of the S-4 filing\]) but have significant cash burn projected for the next two years ($385M), ^(\[see page 149 of the S-4 filing\]) they received $188M from the SPAC, but still need an additional $155M which they will likely raise by selling hella shares.

&amp;#x200B;

# Additional mechanics at play

There are two dynamics that can make this drop juicier.

The first is, as shares become available PIPE investors will be able to go short to protect their downside in their position.

There is another element to this. We’re all probably familiar with the gamma squeeze mechanic by now. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/rvj8v6/essc_what_is_a_gamma_squeeze/) a good explainer if you aren’t familiar, basically the tail wags the dog. OTM options buying drives option sellers to hedge to avoid taking a position on the underlying security.

If people are piling into OTM calls, MMs will have to buy shares; likewise, if people are piling into OTM puts, MMs will have to sell shares -- exacerbating the situation. Hopefully what you get is a parabolic move. I’m hoping for a parabolic move downwards.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

Long story short, HLGN may continue to dump and we can benefit:

* It got pumped because it was low float, actually it is high float and the float will continue to increase.
* Insiders will sell because their returns are already so good and the company will sell because they need money badly.
* Put buyers might cause MMs to delta hedge and create a gamma squeeze.
* Bill Gates is like king midas if everything king midas touched was shit. He invested early and I allege that he wants to leave the retail investor with a big bag o shit

Why is that important? There is no drug that is able to treat Alzheimer’s.  Biogen came out with a treatment recently that has been a disaster.  Simufilam has excellent phase 2 results that has NEVER been seen before.  Alzheimer’s is a multi billion dollar market and projected to be a trillion dollar market by 2050.

What’s the problem? SAVA is shorted by almost 40%. Why? Because there was a citizens petition made to the FDA in August by certain individuals.  These individuals claimed to be whistleblowers but turned out they were short sava and had ties with competitors.  They made claims of manipulated images that were CLEARED by two reputable journals.

So what’s the problem? The corrupt hedgies have been keeping this stock down by heavily shorting and naked shorting this stock.  They’ve been putting out BS hit pieces to support their abuse.  SAVA has something big and revolutionary and they want to destroy SAVA and create their own version of the drug. I have never seen as many negative attacks on a stock ever.

This stock has huge potential.  At the very least 10x and could 20x 🚀🚀. FDA deadline is approaching and phase 3 is still underway with dosing already happening.  These shorts are starting to get nervous and possibly being investigated by DOJ.

THIS STOCK IS MORE THAN A SQUEEZE

Here are the fundamentals: 

43% of the world's uranium supply comes from Kazakhstan, through one arms-length public-private corporation - Kazatomprom (LSE: KAP). Kazakhstan just fired their entire government last night and is in the process of descending into chaos: [Easily Google'd News](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/asia/kazakhstan-fuel-protests-emergency-wednesday-intl/index.html)

KAP is expectedly tanking and every North American uranium play is up ~10% today. 

The inbound supply &amp; demand gap is already making itself apparent in a rapidly increasing uranium spot price: [Twitter uranium spot tracker](https://twitter.com/numerco?t=-vEnG2gH6bSOVNxZjwhIEA&amp;s=09)

Unfortunately, many of the most-likely successful plays in this space are very low market cap mining companies which are too trashy, even for this sub reddit. NYSE:CCJ is your gateway ticket to the uranium space. Feel free to message me to discuss the real hot garbage corporations that may go 10x.

7153,wallstreetbets,The Great Money Earning (GME)," 

Welcome to my TED talk 

Short and with no intro (I put a lot of effort into writing a long DD but it was removed instantly, don´t know why)

Various people have found repeating cycles on gAmeStop

How can retail investors make bank on these FTD cycles? And how do we fuk up those HF algos (hypothetical calculation added later)?

* Here we enter the hypothetical sphere:

As you might know a lot of people are buying and holding GME since last January.

Plus some apes are registering their shares in their own name via DRS.

This leaves the stock quite illiquid -&gt; so a big enough buy in would make the stock go BOOM

However you do you and I do me, so huge timed buy ins are no option...

&amp;#x200B;

* Did I here **options**?

Yeah.

I assume you guys know how options work so i add the hypothetical calculation:

If 10% of WSB would buy one Jan 21 2022 $145 call contract (cost 700$) , with a delta of 0.4, Market Makers would have to hedge 44 million shares. -&gt; stock go BOOOOOM

if WSB wants to be safer and get Feb 18 2022 $160 call contract (cost 1k$), with a delta of 0.4 -&gt; same BOOOM

&amp;#x200B;

[some retarded calculations with current prices \(01\/05\/22 1:10\)](https://preview.redd.it/c72m5ritxw981.png?width=447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a0ddaa21b01d7d7ba45c60684efb3233fa40a4)

&amp;#x200B;

They make it look bad right now, but have you heard about the ""Dip before the RIP""? You are here right now.

Do as you wish, but we will see somewhat similar price action as January 2021!

This is the chance for retail to blow up evil algos!

Source: [https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-buy-now/](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-buy-now/)

Highlight: We chose to invest in Visa recognizing its dominant domestic and international position in the lucrative credit processing market and proactive investments in currency related operations.

**Non-intrinsic value related reasons for undervaluation:**

* Coronavirus has resulted in major damage to ⅓ of Visa’s payments volume: travel, food, entertainment, hospitality (negative demand shock)
* The threat of a delta variant is spooking investors and preventing a true bounceback
* Legal/regulatory risks make investors hesitant (e. Brazilian central bank halting the business’ operations in Brazil)

**Why it’s a good long term play:**

* Strategy to aggressively expand into the digital space, such as contactless payments and e-commerce likely to be a major revenue driver as retail space dwindles.
   * The rise in e-commerce benefits Visa since Visa’s share of digital commerce is approximately 3 times greater than a point of sale transactions. (according to Visa).
* Now is a good time to get in since global spending is about to bounce back, provided the delta variant doesn’t become substantially worse
* Visa is making bold new moves into the rapidly growing retail trading indusgtry, partnering with PayNearby, India’s leading online bank and digital payments network, and RBL Bank to launch SoftPos and mPOS to create a large retail network where contactless payments can be made on smartphones
* First major payments network to accept transactions in USD Coin (first move advantage over competitors in highly competitive market) → piloting done with partnership with C.rypto.com and also doing this by partnering with Anchorage, 1st federally chartered digital asset bank
* Acquired Tink for $2 billion, which will create a network of more than 3,400 banks in Europe with over 250 million customers
* Coronavirus positive: Movement to tap-to-pay and contactless payments boosting demand for Visa services (shift away from cash payments)
* Rise of buy now pay later stimulating growth of Visa installments (a BNPL program)
* Has greater market share of the payments processing industry than Mastercard, with which Visa makes up a duopoly (around 2 times greater processing volume)
   * Indirect network effects: as Visa payments become more popular, companies have a greater incentive to use Visa payments/software (in addition to the relatively more recognizable/reputable brand name)
* Largest share of revenue is Visa DPS, which has remained the US’ most used processing service of its kind (to process, clear and manage Visa transactions) → Closely tied with market share of Visa cards

**Limitations**:

* Government regulation (antitrust) cracking down on Visa’s expansion due to duopoly status. This may prevent Visa from acquiring new businesses it sees as worth buying and enabling competitors to take away greater market share
* Rise of competition from other firms in primary transactions business, as well as highly competitive BNPL industry (which Visa is not as dominant in)
* (unlikely/far off): Rise of future currencies take away market share from Visa’s payments processing segment.
   * Visa is proactive in this respect, as evidenced by their acquisition of YellowPepper, a currency based fintech company.
* Intense competition from digital payment providers like Paypal, which is expanding. This may limit Visa’s potential to grow its digital payments presence, therefore preventing it from reaping the gains of a rapidly growing digital payments industry.

… Even so, we believe the negatives are outweighed by positives.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analyst Price target:**

The 32 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Visa Inc have a median target of $280.60, supporting our claim of undervaluation (current price $230.65). [Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=v) (CNN Money)

From Tipranks (also well reputed): Based on 18 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Visa in the last 3 months. The average price target is **$280.44**. Very similar targets to the CNN money analyst predictions, implying broad based analyst agreement that the stock is currently undervalued. [Source](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/v/forecast)

I still see some upside with them but not as much as they’ve experienced this past year. 

On the other hand, VW stock seems to have plenty of room for growth. In the past two year they are only up 8% compared to 85% and 170% from GM and Ford. There P/E is only 5.3 compared to 8.9 (GM) and 34 (Ford). Most of the increase in stock price for GM and Ford has had to do with news surrounding the EVs they are making (I’m using GM and Ford as examples but VW has lagged pretty much all the large car manufacturers). VW is arguably one of the best positioned for EVs. They are investing $100 billion on EVs, their CEO is all bought in, they are looking at manufacturing their own batteries, and their ID4 has done pretty well with over 70,000 purchases.

Having watched SPAC S1 Filings closely, it's taking 3 to 15 calendar days for these to deemed ""EFFECTIVE"" lately. As soon as this filing becomes EFFECTIVE, the 150 Million shares held by the PIPE buyers (at $15/share) can be sold freely on the market.

Without a doubt, some portion of the 150M shares will be sold given that the PIPE participants are looking at a &gt;50% gain. 

Roughly 45% of the pipe (\~70M shares) are ""Fast money"" hedge funds that want to get out ASAP.

That's 70M shares of selling pressure into a stock that has a current float of 260M shares. More importantly, average daily trading volumes for $LCID is about 10M shares. On the surface, this is a lot of volume with strong incentives to sell relative to the existing liquidity of the stock.

The story gets more interesting when you consider the 45M shares currently shorted on LCID, and the astronomical 130% borrow rate. A non-trivial number of these shares are likely frontrunning the PIPE unlock and are looking to buy into the selling from this event. 

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond KFC officially launched (as predicted by South Park) and McDonald's McPlant is winning over the UK with US launch just a matter of time per both companies. Is this the next big Short Squeeze play?,"KFC and Beyond Meat just announced their nationwide launch of the Beyond Fried Chicken. This was the product that had several successful tests across the country over the last couple years and will now finally be available coast to coast. 

I was surprised to not see more of a price jump on the highly anticipated news and then realized it might have something to do with the 39% Short Interest on Beyond Meat. This is has gone up significantly from 20% earlier last year on the company's struggles with COVID-related challenges with the restaurant industry, a significant revenue source, severely impacted. 

But they've got some tasty deals lined up. McDonald's is trialing the McPlant across Europe and it's getting rave reviews. The KFC deal is also expected to be one of a few big launches given the outspokenly warm relationship with YUM brands. Considering Beyond Meat just opened up a production facility in China, the high demand Asian markets are also looking good for the future.

Is this the next big Short Squeeze play? Certainly 39% SI is simply ridiculous for the leading brand as the plant based wave continues to gain momentum.

First off let me start by saying that the ticker symbol is literally PRTY. What more can you ask for?  
In all seriousness though, I'm balls deep into this company (5 figures) for a few reasons.

1. Pre-Covid this was well into the $12 range. Like all other sectors, it took a massive dip and didn't quite recover like the rest. Airlines and cruises have all somewhat recovered but PRTY has been trailing. It might take a few weeks, it might take a few months but this has potential to double your investment.
2. Solid company with solid financials for 30+ years.
3. Number three, and this is the big one, PRTY doesn't have any competition. If you're throwing a birthday party, bachelor party, baby shower, orgy etc. you need party supplies. Party City (PRTY) barely has any competition in this sector. Yes, you could go to Dollar Tree and get a few balloons, but PRTY is the only store that is STRICLY party supplies. They have close to no competition in this sector. And which sector is going to boom after Covid? Parties!!! Everybody has been locked up and away from family and friends for 2 years that they'll be dying to throw parties. Omicron fears are slowly dying and the proof is in the pudding. PRTY up 30% in the last 3 weeks. It's currently at $6.4 and $9 is right around the corner.

This is not a recommendation for anyone else to take a position in ALTO.  We do not know your individual situation or risk tolerance and this stock may have a lot of volatility.  Additionally, our thesis may take a lot longer to play out then we anticipate. Our fiduciary duty is to our clients and we are unlikely to post future updates on this position until we have already taken actions for our clients.

ALTO should be a $20 to $25 stock, at a bare minimum, within 24 months with the timing depending upon how quickly and convincingly ALTO management can explain the transformation to the market vs having to actually prove out the transformation over time by executing on the plan.  At a minimum ALTO should be valued at $10 within the next year as several major catalysts occur.

The largest near-term catalyst for ALTO is a Q4 earnings pre-announcement. During the last quarter, ALTO guided to a full-year MINIMUM EBITDA of $40M. We believe that ALTO is set to significantly outperform this metric and is likely to post a full-year EBITDA of over $60M or 50%+ from the current minimum guidance that was provided. Crush margins (the difference between what fuel ethanol can be sold less the cost of inputs such as corn) in November and December spiked to incredible levels around $1.50.  In an earnings call earlier in the year, ALTO explain that each 1 cent change in the crush margin is $1M in annualized EBITDA (at the time the crush margin was a negative 25 cents!). We believe that ALTO was able to lock in the November and December margins at over $1.00 based on their commentary on an early November earnings call that mentioned that they had just started locking in margins:

&gt;Given the unusually positive short-term spreads in ethanol and corn, we've begun to -- we've begun locking in the margin on our fuel-grade production through year-end. 

The crush margin continued to rocket higher over the next several weeks; therefore, we believe that ALTO did not lock in margins too quickly and may have actually been able to lock near the highs for November and December.  We believe that ALTO was also able to lock-in margins for Q1, 2022 at levels that will significantly exceed Q1 2020 margins. Additionally, ALTO had spare specialty alcohol capacity that could have been quickly switched over to fuel ethanol.  Ironically, the exact opposite scenario that existed in 2020 where ALTO was trying to bring-on specialty alcohol capacity as quickly as possible to meet high sanitizer demand. 

Even better, ALTO announced in September that they were re-starting the Magic Valley facility ""[https://ir.altoingredients.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/575/alto-ingredients-inc-launches-enhanced-protein-project](https://ir.altoingredients.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/575/alto-ingredients-inc-launches-enhanced-protein-project)""

We believe it is likely that this facility was fully restarted at some point in Q4 which most likely allowed ALTO to lock-in margins at the Magic Valley facility as well for whatever period it was operational in Q4.

Given all of these different benefits, we believe it is plausible that ALTO may have more than doubled Q4 2020 EBITDA of 16.4M (resulting in annual EBITDA of over $60M for 2021 - significantly higher than the $40M bottom-end guidance).  ALTO also announced the sale of their Stockton facility on November 8th for $24M in cash that they used to pay off 100% of their term debt (debt that had an interest rate of over 10% just a year earlier!). More importantly, the sale removed $600,000 per quarter in negative EBITDA carrying costs - in addition to the $400,000 per quarter that the Madera facility was adding. Going forward ALTO will now have $4M in annual savings by not having to maintain the facilities that had been idled since early 2020.

Therefore, in the very short-term (by the end of January) we expect ALTO will need to pre-report earnings (instead of waiting until the March earnings date) in order to be transparent with the market with how substantially they have outperformed prior guidance for the year.

Furthermore, we believe it would be the perfect time for management/board of directors to announce a share repurchase plan.  ALTO has about 9M warrants outstanding that expire in April with an exercise price of $9.76. This means that ALTO could repurchase a significant amount of shares, as they are now flush with cash, that they could then immediately sell for $9.76 for a nearly 100% gain from the current stock price of less than $5 a share. If the stock price immediately appreciates past $10 per share on the update and share repurchase plan, ALTO may not be able to utilize the share repurchase plan, but it would allow them to receive the nearly $90M in proceeds from the sale of the warrants to more quickly fund their 2022 improvement projects.

The long-term thesis for ALTO is in-tact. While they will always produce fuel ethanol, they have completely transformed into also being able to produce essential ingredients at much higher margins as well as significant amounts of specialty alcohol where there is less competition and where pricing is more opaque (less commoditized). During the last quarter, ALTO announced several capital improvements that would begin to impact 2022:

* Yeast facility / Pekin dryer upgrade should contribute approximately $5M in annual EBITDA.
* Expanded corn oil production capacity at Pekin should contribute approximately $4M in annual EBITDA.
* Sale of idled facilities in California should contribute $4M in annual EBITDA savings - plus that have helped ALTO to completely eliminate all term-debt resulting in significant savings on debt interest.
* CoPromax project will contribute approximately $9M in annual EBITDA ($5M in 2022 and $9M a year in 2023 and beyond).

In total these projects will increase 2022 EBITDA by $18.5M, $22M in annual EBITDA by 2023, and once the CoPromax system is rolled-out to the other three mills an additional $34M in annual EBITDA could be obtained per Mike Kandris on the last earnings call.

More importantly, none of this includes the carbon sequestration project or the fact that ALTO has not yet contracted out all of their specialty alcohol capacity, and THAT is why the market doesn't understand ALTO yet.

***The market believes that 2020 was an anomaly that allowed ALTO to sell specialty alcohol (primarily sanitizer) at very high prices (and lock in some of that pricing for 2021) that won't exist in the future while also creating a glut of sanitizer that will result in reduced sales.***

What the market is missing, is that while sanitizer demand and pricing have fallen substantially in 2021, ALTO still managed to contract more specialty alcohol in 2021 vs 2020 and it will be the same case for 2022. ALTO is growing the business as a trusted name and with certifications that no other North American producer of specialty alcohol has obtained yet. 

With 140 million gallons of capacity entering 2021, ALTO is the largest producer of specialty alcohol in the US. At the end of Q4, 2020, ALTO announced that they had contracted 70 million gallons of specialty alcohol (50% of their annual capacity) and only 10% of those sales (7 million gallons) were sanitizer sales:

""As a result, our production mix today is well diversified with approximately 90% of our contracted volume being sold to major producers of food and beverage and home and beauty products, and only 10% of our contracted volume going to sanitizer products. Although we've seen sanitizer demand return to pre-COVID levels, we do expect additional tailwinds and demand to increase as restaurants, arenas, theaters, offices and stadiums reopen. As social activity increase, existing low-quality sanitizer inventories will be consumed and replaced by higher-quality products that utilize USP-grade alcohol. In short, we are well positioned to support customer needs for USP, API and beverage-grade alcohol for 2021 and beyond.""

Therefore, even if pricing has fallen again in 2022, ALTO should be able to offset this with increased sales of specialty alcohol (in areas other than hand sanitizer) that offset the price declines since they have the capacity to double 2021 contracted specialty alcohol sales over time! The market doesn't understand that while the entire 140M gallons weren't contracted immediately, it's a growing business; furthermore, it may have allowed them to generate significant sales of fuel ethanol during Q4s crush margin spike without having to restart any facilities. Therefore, ALTO may have been the greatest beneficiary of the spike in ethanol pricing last quarter. 

Interestingly, sanitizer may soon become another tailwind due to recent FDA announcement that occurred in Q4. The FDA announced ([https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-22108.pdf](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-22108.pdf)) that they are now ending the temporary COVID rule that let companies make hand sanitizer under reduced levels of regulations. These companies must no cease all production by the end of 2021. Therefore, while there is currently a surplus of hand sanitizer, with the elimination of the marginal producers that were able to produce very cheap, low quality hand sanitizer, this surplus should be eliminated in 2022 and become an additional source of demand in 2023 and beyond.

Finally, carbon sequestration. ALTO has been hinting towards an announcement for over a year, but the reality is that they needed the infrastructure bills to become more solidified before they could finalize their plans in regards to which partner they would outsource the project to, if they would even outsource the project, and how much each party would pay. ALTO wants to maximize shareholder value without limiting how quickly that can move forward on other capital improvements. ALTO should now be able to finalize carbon sequestration plans with a contract that takes into account and can adjust to whatever Congress passes going forward.

From the last earnings call:

&gt;**Bryon McGregor**  
&gt;  
&gt;So, as you think about for -- a couple things. One is that with the latest infrastructure bill we're seeing a lot of -- we've seen some significant benefits or expect to see significant benefits from that. Really, it manifests itself in a couple of forms. One is that the 45Q program would boost or the increase per pay. The tax credit available on a per metric ton basis of Co2 would increase from $50 per gallon to -- or $50 per metric ton to $85 per metric ton. That would be eligible and available beginning at the time of completion for 12 years from the time that they begin to claim the credit. And also they've introduced direct pay so rather than having to go through and find and potentially have to pay for significant -- pay a significant fee to parties that would be able to monetize that tax credit. That means more of the economic share is retained within the structure.  
&gt;  
&gt;The positive thing for us is that we're in development or we're in discussion with multiple parties and really just exploring kind of the full array of options, everything from handling and doing it on our own and internalizing as much as that value is possible to effectively selling it at the fence line. And really it's just about being efficient and allocating risk amongst those parties who can best absorb those risk efficiently and effectively at a low cost. So, more to come on that.

Per a 2019 report ([https://www.ogci.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CCUS-Investments-Day-2019-%E2%80%93-Booklet.pdf](https://www.ogci.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CCUS-Investments-Day-2019-%E2%80%93-Booklet.pdf)) ALTO's Pekin facility could store up to 750,000 tons per year of CO2:

https://preview.redd.it/wtclhapxdy481.png?width=1067&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9afd36e601d19d61ae620a5f51c68e98bcf4a8e2

At $50 to $85 per metric ton, that is an additional $37.5M to $63.75M in annual EBITDA for a project that should have minimal expenses beyond the initial capital requirements! Additionally, the infrastructure bill that was just passed and signed into law included $2.5 billion in funds towards helping the private sector to begin building out carbon capture/sequestration projects such as low interest loans.

ALTO will be generating well over $100M in annual EBITDA in the future, it is only a matter of time, and with a current market cap of around $350M and no term debt, the current valuation of ALTO makes very little sense especially when compared to companies like Green Plains.

7342,wallstreetbets,I would really appreciate if this thing popped soon. Family is getting desperate.,"This past year has been extremely difficult for many of us i’m sure, but for others it has been even more so. For me 2021 ended with the loss of someone I never truly believed I would lose. My dad had been in the hospital for 4 months prior to his passing, and for just about that entire time I was overseas. Only for the last week of his life was I able to make it home. When I walked into that room and held his hand I had never felt pain that deep. He looked like a completely different person, mostly due to the fact that he had lost so much weight during that time. It hurt me beyond belief to see him that way. I spent a few days in the hospital by his side, trying my best to have some kind of conversation with him. Unfortunately that was also made difficult due to him having a trach so that the only way I could understand him was by reading his lips. After a few days I was at our house when I received a phone call from my mom saying that I needed to come to the hospital asap. When I arrived I was sat down with her and the doctor and was told that he wasn’t going to get better after they discovered another infection in his blood and they realized no matter how much meds he received his body was giving up. So I sat there with my father, squeezing his hand, as they gave him a bunch of sedative and morphine, and shut off the machines keeping him alive. And I watched him take his last breath. It still feels surreal to think he is gone. All I want is to go back and do things differently. Spend more time with him, tell him how grateful I am. But now I can’t. I don’t even know if he understood what I said to him before he passed. And now my mom has to raise my little sister alone and has almost 2 million in hospital bills (only from the first hospital) that I wish I could help with.

HOOD is about 3% down today, and 6% yesterday. It seems like HOOD is gonna reach one digit at some point. 

Some people said that HOOD is a buy at $38, but we kept shorting. People said it´s a buy at $20, we kept shorting. People said yesterday HOOD is a buy rn, guess what? HOOD is down 10% in the last two days.

You all gotta accept the fact that HOOD is going to be a penny stock soon, it´s a matter of weeks and months. 

So good luck for those, who bought the dip lmaooo :)

7387,wallstreetbets,"Deep value: Alibaba (I know I know, it’s jaded. But hear me out and weigh in)","I’m going to keep this very simple bc its the most basic and easy to understand metric there is (IMO). In 2021 BABA had about 273.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its books. Baba currently has about 2.75 billion shares outstanding. Basic math time: price per share (“PPS”)=cash &amp;cash equivalents/shares outstanding. So PPS= 272.2/2.75. PPS= $98.98. Baba is currently trading close to its value in cash alone (essentially). Let that sink in. Hypothetically, rhetorically speaking, if baba shut down today, just it’s cash and cash equivalents could be doled out to shareholders and each shareholder would walk away with $99 in his/her pocket (no, this is not how bankruptcy or divestiture actually works. Again, speaking rhetorically). So at the current share price, or lower, baba is an obvious deep deep value buy. Baba has other valuable assets, good will (essentially, name brand recognition for those who don’t know what “good will” is), insane revenue (which is growing), its profitable, advanced IT infrastructure and intellectual property . . . I don’t
Understand how or why this keeps dropping. Even accounting for regulatory risk, the current share price doesn’t make much sense. Any thoughts or opinions?

SKLZ hit all time low yesterday.  If you look at their Finviz data, the company doesn't look too shabby, actually.  During their last earnings they made 102.07M in sales and, for the first time, delivered positive net earnings of 50.78M.  The company is in best shape now than it ever was.  And yet it's at the lowest they've ever been (the high was $46.30).

Yesterday I yoloed about USD 3 grand into weekly options cuz it seems that the upside of sorts is inevitable.  What do you think?

Below is some data supporting my decision.

Last time i thought i didnt have to pay interest if i would pay it back within 10 months, so thats not true. 

So my plan is getting 2k in credit. Paying that back over the next 10 months (while still DCA). I would have to pay a total of 2145€, so 145€ on top of the credit. I am gonna ask my boss tomorrow if he ll fire me within the next 10 months. If not i think i am gonna do it as my low salary is still enough to pay 220 a month. 

I am just here to ask you for ideas. Eg i ll definetly invest into the computer money space (cant say the c word here). If i am unlucky it just might crash. But DCA is too slow and i want to see what might be possible. If it worked out i ll do it again in 10 months with more credit lol.",1641389941

The move could position Palantir  to boost its growing commercial business outside the U.S. 

Hyundai  Heavy will use Palantir’s data analysis software to improve the way its  affiliate groups operate in fields including shipbuilding, offshore  engineering and energy and industrial machinery processes, the companies  announced Tuesday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. The multiyear  deal is valued at more than $25 million, according to a person familiar  with the arrangement who asked not to be identified discussing private  information. 

Once the platform is built, the companies will  create a joint venture to commercialize the new tools, a move that could  help Palantir software gain traction with global industrial companies.  Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said the project represented a new  model, allowing customers to only pay for what they use, and exercise  more control over the process.

Starting with $1,000 and going all in on the best performing stock each day?

Transcript:

“If you had $1,000 and knew exactly the right stock to trade every day, how much money could you make in a year? In 2021, trillions.

A trader who began 2021 with $1,000 in a brokerage account and put all of the money in the best-performing S&amp;P 500 company each day of 2021 would have $1.3 trillion in that account today—and hold claim to completing an effectively impossible task.

By March 8, they would have reached $85,163, exceeding the US household median annual income. Buying shares of Equifax on April 22 would have brought total gains to over $1 million. A month later the balance would hit $5 million with a trade in Enphase Energy.

The trader would be a billionaire on Aug. 27, after riding Occidental Petroleum through a 6.9% one-day gain. They’d reach $10 billion on Oct. 18 and $100 billion on Nov. 16. They would have eclipsed Elon Musk as the richest person in the world after hitting $285 billion on Dec. 2 (Musk was worth a mere $284 billion on that day, according to Bloomberg). Over the course of the year, the trader would not have taken a loss on any single day.

How to trade a perfect 2021

Here’s a day-by-day calendar of the S&amp;P 500 stock they would have had to invest 100% of their portfolio in to pull off the perfect trading year.


Moderna, Tesla, and APA shares were frequent top performers

Although the S&amp;P 500 index has 500 members, only 137 companies were the top performers on any of the 252 trading days in 2021. The most frequent top performers were Moderna, Tesla, and oil driller APA:


Of course, once the account balance had grown past a certain point, it would be impossible to put it into any stock without drastically affecting the stock’s price. In many cases, putting it all into the best-performing company on a given day would have been impossible—there wouldn’t have been enough shares to buy.


Our analysis also did not take into account trading fees, nor changes in the composition of the S&amp;P index through the year. As in prior years, we assumed that all companies allowed for investment in fractional shares.

Moreover, even if one made the impossibly optimistic assumption that picking the best stock of the day is a 50-50 guess, there would be a one in 7.24 quattuorvigintillion (7.24 × 1075) chance of matching these results.”",1641365317

**Let me start by saying this is my opinion only and I am not a financial advisor however this is a post on why I think $ETON can be a great runner for its current FDA PDUFA Date January 29th** **2022 for Zonisamide Oral Suspension. You will see on the picture below Eton believes only the site inspection is holding them back as they received a CRL in March due to travel bans but now have had enough time and travel bans lifted this should be no problem.**

**Eton is not a one hit wonder company this company has 6 FDA approved products yes already Approved.** 

**Starting the New Year with another approval hopefully now on Jan 29th** **will make 2022 a huge year for Eton. They just setup launch in the fourth quarter of 2021 for 3 products and have 4 additional products that have been submitted to the FDA that could be approved and launched in 2022**

**Now here’s what I believe will be bigger Eton had a Human Factor Study for Lamotrigine and stated in their conference call on November 15,2021 that their partner was going to submit the results to the FDA later in the month which should allow for the potential approval in the first half of 2022. This would be a big catalyst to add to their PDUFA Jan 29th** **if we get news that FDA accepted the study and its complete.**

**They have plenty of cash on hand and are not new to the FDA Approval process, their last PDUFA went over $6.50 in my opinion I think this would be a great time to get in as they will start generating a lot of revenue with all these products coming to market.**

Marketing campaigns to highlight the availability of system upgrade programs for patients and to increase overall patient awareness

Payor engagement regarding reimbursement and coverage transitions

7561,wallstreetbets,The US stock Exchange," 

The US Government and it's corrupt officials were colluding with eachother since the very beginning. They all are aware of what they did and what they continue to do. The US CEC and DTCC is infiltrated by current citadel employees(one you are and citadel employee, you are always on their bankroll). The same is said about the politicians, as you can see that they are paid very well for very few public speaking. They have all colluded with each other. That is why in an unprecedented event ensued on January 27, 2020, they prevented the buying GME and kept the sell button so people would mass panic sell. They knew that the securities (Short Swaps) were in trouble because it was backed by the federal reserve. 

The MOASS will not be just GME going tits up, but also: some other stocks. Can't name because of the censorship of this subreddit. That is one of few in that swap. These greedy fucks are not only fucking with one basket but others as well. The marijuana stocks have been heavily manipulated and I think they are in a swap of their own. I'm speculating but there must be more baskets.

These Swaps baskets are designed to bring the company to bankruptcy so their competitors can buy what ever assets they want. For example Trade patents and the like.

That's why you see new CEO being brought,  hired for almost dead companies. These CEO's then pillage the companies. Look at the ex CEO of Sears and how he handled that company. This has been happening all around the world including in the Canadian Stock Exchange.

All these hedge funds are colluding with each other, including the Federal government and reserve, in the name of pure greed. Fuck the American Tax payey. The rich don't pay there fare share so I guess they figured they can get away from fucking them more.

For example a stock in Vancouver that is being heavily manipulated is Netcoins(Digital Brokage), a direct competition of Coinbase. Coinbase is backed by these hedge fund because they are using coinbase to print fake tokens from bitcoins. This is another method these fuckers have been gaining capital. They have been manipulating the market to the extent of the federal reserve. This is why Powell is printing as much fake money as they can, while he still can. 

I think the Biden adminstration is aware of this and is trying to prevent a total economic collapse, they have been kicking the can down the road and getting ready for the MOASS, then an economic recession or depression worse than the 2008 recession but with different securities. 

The same people that are in power are still using the same corrupt methods to maintain power and rob the American Tax payers. The same banks the caused the 08 crash will cause the next crash.

Hopefully this time, the corrupt fucks get heavy jail time for their crimes against humanity and the world. Because the US currency is the main currency, this shit trickles down across the world",1641355960

**Sector** \- Consumer Discretionary

**Price** **momentum** \- Negative

**-Macro-**

*Current macro situations are a combination of China Evergrande, looming interest rate hikes, 1M+ omicron variant spread.

**Basic EPS** is negative, vs 10.44 industry average

**MktCap** is approximated 1.5 billion

I live on disability and since the death of my parents, I try to improve my situation slightly as I saved up a lot when I could. A year ago I took a line on Ubisoft when it was around 73. The stock lost a lot and is now around 42. I managed to cost average down the price to 60 euros, but if I sold now the loss for me would be about 28 k euros. One part of me would take the loss but I feel this is the emotional part of me. The rational part of me tells me it might rise back in next months/this year because of the number of ips the company owns, the background of the company, ability to change and evolve which I believe is better than for examples Blizzard.

**Ticker** \- Bed Bath and Beyond, BBBY 

**Earnings Time** \- 1/6/2022 BMO

**Sector** \- Consumer Discretionary

**Price** **momentum** \- Negative

**-Macro-**

*Current macro situations are a combination of China Evergrande, looming interest rate hikes, 1M+ omicron variant spread. This poses a decent risk to retail stores such as BBBY if lockdowns and restrictions are imposed again.* ***Omicron and shipping congestion show that macro issues are negative for BBBY.***

**-Fundamental-**

**Quick Ratio** of 0.7 vs 0.58 industry average

**Basic EPS** is negative, vs 10.44 industry average

**MktCap** is approximated 1.5 billion

**Cash on Hand** \- probably near the 500m range, due to the acceleration of buybacks

**Net Debt** \- 1.18B

*Mark Tritton plans on turning around BBBY with a 3 prong strategy that includes* 

1. *Redefining the value proposition*
2. *Becoming a compelling shopping destination*
3. *Modernizing operations*

**Prior Revenue Performance** \- 1.99B vs 2.06B expected

**Prior EPS Performance -** 0.04$ vs 0.52$ expected 

*In addition to the nice list, I personally believe that BBBY needs to figure out how to transition out of their couponing that eats margins excessively.* ***Fundamentally, stock feels neutral to negative.***

\-**Sentimental-**

**Wall street analyst rating** \- 2.55 Neutral

**Wall street price target** \- 18.27 Average

**Stocktwits sentiments** \- Generally positive with small increase in message volume

**WSB Sentiments** \- Short squeeze candidate, popular, not top 10 stock 

**FURU Sentiments** \- No mentions

**Retail Investor Perception** \- Dying company, retail is dying to amazon, highly shorted. Feels like a shittier version of GME if there is a turnaround potential. 

**Revenue expectations -** 0.01$ basically breakeven

**EPS expectations -** 1.95B

Cash accounts are not subject to pattern day trading rules but are subject to GFV's. Pattern day trading (PDT) rules only pertain to margin accounts.

A good faith violation (GFV) occurs when a cash account buys a stock or option with unsettled funds and liquidates the position before the settlement date of the sale that generated the proceeds. Stocks and ETFs settle trade date plus two business days, or more commonly known as T+2, and options settle the next business day (T+1). A cash account is not limited to a number of day trades. However, you can only day trade with settled funds.

[here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220104006026/en/) . Price jumped after hours. The DD was posted about two months ago by some other people and the stock is finally making a move.

180 days is a huge improvement to their 90 days product. They also have a 365 days device in the works for those who want the long play. Currently competitors have 14 day devices which has its pros and cons, but the 180 and 365 days will be a game changer where there will be less burden on the patient.

They’re supposedly ready to launch shortly (weeks?) after FDA approval since they already have this in Europe. This will be a major impact to their financials.

If you look at some of their competitors like $DXCM or $PODD, they were ridiculously cheap when they started. $SENS had some issues in the past few years including Covid which just hit them hard because they’re much smaller than the big boys. Now they are just about to hit a major catalyst to get a piece of the pie. I remember projections showed they were still going to be unprofitable this year but with this in the pipeline, profit starts turning in 2023 if they hit their projections. So far they’re on point except the FDA approval is a month late.

Now for the retards that actually look into it, short interest was 20-30%. Now sure how that changes with the spike. Looking forward to tomorrow’s opening. I guess I’m supposed to attach emojis 🚀🚀🚀

7668,wallstreetbets,is wd-40 earnings actually a good play?,"thats right its me the guy that posted my favorite wd-40 meme

i thought wd-40 was funny, until i actually looked at its earnings history, TL;DR it has a small habit of blowing estimates out of the water and im wondering if it could this time.

this is posted as discussion cause idk wtf im doing, im not a financial adviser, and maybe im looking for some confirmation bias too.

&amp;#x200B;

so for some history, in october 2020 earning did GREAT and it went from around $250 to $300, it stayed there with another good earnings report, then dropped in april 2021 from the supply chain issues. since then it has had some good earning until the last one, where it did pretty bad because of covid.

**LEFT SIDE: ESTIMATED EPS                     RIGHT SIDE: ACTUAL EPS**

[10\/20 is when it spiked.](https://preview.redd.it/iccxp990kr981.jpg?width=1259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2edc5bea9f0e41fe32d98c539c3270d34d3a09)

so from that i feel like the april 2021 sell off was pretty exaggerated because the next earnings did really well. 

then fall 2021. covid started picking back up, here is thier last earnings info:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5cx6cirpkr981.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=894ed83b2392bd51060281912bd587d8adf6bf95

so they didnt do terrible in earnings, but apparently income last quarter was terrible. im thinking this jan 6th will be better all around for a few reasons:

1, people adjust to covid over time, it starts with a freak out then settles down.

2, holidays more people have time off to build and fix things.

3, seasonal workers like restaurants slow down, which means more clean up, more precious wd-40 (and 3 in 1 oil which actually is fucking great fyi)

and final reason the estimated eps this time is still low at $1.25. soo if they have an increase in sales they should reach or exceed that, i also read their ceo has a price target of $260 and after the april drop said $250 is too low. its even lower now at $240

they have pretty stable revenue anyway, and are expecting alot of growth.

Its not much I wanted to buy is as a test run. I am now highly considering increasing this position to 500+ shares. 

Before answering the title try reading this boring stuff ;

A few months back I told someone about considering buying PLTR at work. They  replied, isn't that one  the wsb stocks.... sounds like gambling ...no thank you. 


.... in my opinion PLTR is going to 1 trillion dollar  valuation by 2030 . I will not put a potatoe in my ass even if it doesn't happen because  if I'm even a quarter right I will have made some nice gains.

There are some myths out there that  perhaps keeps the price down. Those myths I believe I designed to bring PLTR at a price so attractive for nice gains.


1. Dilution ;  dilution isn't always bad,  if you are diluting to payout Talent to stay at the top this is far from bad. Another example is   Alex carp was granted nearly 73 million shares and it was in in December  they were about to be WORTHLESS if not exercised.   When you exercise all the options now you owe SHIT load of money in taxes.  So Alex carp doing  exactly what Elon did when selling is somehow dilution ? A company like PLTR needs massive reinvestments when you want to remain at the top, exactly what Apple , Facebook,  Microsoft,  etc etc do. 


2. The idea of selling personal information is a turn off is also a big misunderstanding.  The whole world is already tracked.... don't be surprised there bud.  Plus PLTR is targeting big dad not personal just for one person type of data. 


3. . Palantir  relies too much on government business, although true that it has been in its past, but in 5 years the commercial business is  now almost at half 44% ( if not more by next quarter ). 

4. PlTR is not generating bottom line profits ,  bullsshittt  look at the numbers free cash flow Q3 was 157 million and 400 million cash flow should be hit  for 2021.  All that money includes the hundreds of millions spent on research and development. Every single cent should be put back for growth. Its not a 20 year old company yiu fool the commercial business is on 5 years old NOT 20 years old.   In the past 5 years PLTR has been KILLING revenue growth exactly due to the commercial side. 


5. No one understands it  this is why  not enough are buying it: if you stick around long enough you'll notice that the commercial side of PLTR has been growing heavily. Clearlt big business understands it because PLTR is about BIG data,  it is not going to matter if you understand it or not.   Retards on a random reddit app started buying it in masses and clearly none of them understood it. So yes people buy things they do not understand clearly because it seems profitable.",1641343227

$MYBUF : The Most Significant Advancement in Science Since They Invented the Sun – Get Cash at a Discount 

Perovskites. Pero what? You heard me. Perovskites. It’s the most significant advancement in science since they invented the Sun. Companies and researchers from around the world, including the Army Research Office and Office of Naval Research are dumping money into perovskites. 

I’m goanna break down for you what Perovskites are. Why they matter. And which companies are poised for huge upside. 

I’m not a chemist. Nor am I an engineer. In fact, I’ve got no formal education of any kind to speak of. So here we go. 

Basically perovskites are family of materials whose structure is made up of calcium titanium oxide. Importantly, their chemical formula is ABX3, where ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent cations and X is an anion that bonds to both. And that X, well, it can be pretty much anything. Think of it like pasta. All pasta is basically wheat. But add cream sauce and you’ve got a fettuccini alfredo. Add shrimp and garlic, and you’ve got shrimp scamp. Cut the noodles wide and add a ragu, you’ve got lasagna. Different dishes in their own right. But at their core, the same pasta structure. Perovskites are basically the same as pasta. Sturcture is the same, but you can add different ingredients to their chemical compound to get different dishes. 

**Okay. So?** 

Perovskites are wildly efficient at absorbing photons of light and channeling electrical currents. This means perovskites are being deployed throughout semiconductor manufacturing as a ***replacement for silicon*****.** Since basically anyone here can remember, semiconductors have been made with silicon as the primary conductor. Hence ‘silicon valley’. Problem is, silicon is expensive ($$$) requires a bunch of processing hoops (no need to get into what they are since I don’t know em anyway) and to use them in something like solar panels- they’ve gotta big old silicon crystals (big) 

**Enter Perovskites**. 

Researchers and manufactures across the globe are beginning to use perovskites instead of silicon as the conductor in semiconductors. Because 

**Perovskites are:** 1) [Cheaper than silicon.](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/se/c9se00948e) 2) [It can be printer on inkjet printers. ](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.0c09485) That’s right. That HP you’ve got lying around could be the future. Just kidding, it probably never worked anyway. 3) 

Not only that. Perovskites are incredibly efficient, and they’re rapidly increasing in efficiency. Especially in solar panels. The conversion efficiency of silicon in solar panels (basically how well it converts solar energy light photons to actual electricity) is 18% - 22%. Perovskites started at 10% photon-to-electricity efficiency in 2012. In 2020, they reached 25.2% ***Perovskites are surpassing silicon as the most effective conductor in solar panels.***

Those orange and yellow dots and that little red triangle with blue in it are perovskite cells being produced. If that was a stock would you buy puts? Didn’t think so. 

**RECAP:** Let’s pause because you probably didn’t read any of that. Perovskites are replacing silicon because they’re cheaper, more easily produced, and more efficient than silicon. And their efficiency is increasing rapidly. 

**Low Production Cost**

Perovskites are expected to decrease rapidly in production cost over time as noted in the chart below. (Source: National Renewable Energy Laboratory)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/65jhoo16br981.png?width=968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56cf0e2e8c9e45d946049002d81213ffafebfe57

**So what can they be used for?** 

1) **Everything**.

2) **Solar Panels** We’ve already touched on their efficiency in solar panels, where they’re being used now. But the fun doesn’t stop there. Solar is a massive industry, I’m not going to look it up because I don’t have the time, but it’s pretty big. Any kind of disruption this size is bound to mean C.o.D.

3) **LASERS** As Fan, et al, say in  [*Nanoscale Semiconductor Lasers*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128141625000030)*,* “As a direct bandgap semiconductor, perovskite exhibits the unique optical properties of bandgap tunability, charge-carrier mobility, defect tolerance, [photoluminescence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/photoluminescence) quantum efficiency and power conversion efficiency, which makes them as promising light-emitting materials for high optical gain, low-threshold and multicolor laser applications.” In other words, bigger lasers mean bigger bucks in your pocket. 

4) **X-Rays** When3-D printed perovskite is combined with graphene it provides a detailed x-ray [image 4x more accurate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2590238520306329) than the best x-ray out there right now. 

5) **Self-Repairing Materials** You read that right. A team of researchers in Israel noticed that if you left damaged solar perovskites in the dark, [they returned to function at or near original efficiency](https://www.perovskite-info.com/israeli-researchers-develop-self-healing-perovskite-nanocrystals). Defects in the structure of perovskites are repaired *on their own*. The potential for self-repairing technology is endless. Perovskite solar panels are also flexible and lightweight. 

6) **IoT | Animal Tracking** One perovskite company has i[ntegrated their solar cells onto animal tracking devices](https://sauletech.com/saule-technologies-wwf-iot-bison/), which give the device about 10+ years of battery. This has huge implications for environmental protection efforts and all Internet of Things applications. 

**Financials; For Whom Do I Make Out This YOLO to?** 

There are a few companies d\*\*ks deep in perovskite manufacturing. These include: Oxford PV, Saule Technologies, Swift Solar, and Aixtron. Saule announced in April 2021 they’re going public, but in Poland. Swift Solar is not public, nor is there any news they will be soon. That leaves Aixtron and Oxford PV. Oxford PV isn’t public but it was heavily invested in by Meyer Burger ($MYBUF) – that’s the real ticker. There’s Aixtron ($AIXXF). And then there’s Toshiba ($TOSYY) 

(There's also Chinese manufacturer China New Borun Group ($BORNY) but they’re down -100.00% in the past 6 months) 

Both $MYBUF (what a name) and $AIXXF make perovskites. To be honest, I can’t make heads or tails of what either of these companies do. 

$AIXXF is a world leader in Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) for semiconductors. Essentially, that means they spray semiconductors with ultrathin films of perovskite. They recently completed a 3-year study in 2019 funded by a bunch of German universities. 

$MYBUF was heavily invested in Oxford PV. Oxford PV was born in the depth of Oxford University’s science labs where they first saw perovskite’s possibility. $MYBUF had an exclusive partnership with Oxford PV that ended messy in June 2021. I’m not going to go into details, you can guess why, but they went their separate ways. $MYBUF is going through a change- it used to supply manufacturing equipment to the solar industry. But now? They make the solar themselves. And they’re doing it with the perovskite custody they got from Oxford PV. 

$MYBUF [announced plans to open a solar production facility in the US](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/10/04/meyer-burger-coming-to-america/)\- up and running by end of this year.  

$MYBUF is on SALE right now at just .46 cents a share. As you can see, $MYBUF had a high of around $340 / share back in ’08 – a price I have every reason to believe it could reach it again.

. 

They’ve also got the strong fundamentals you’d expect to see from an industry visionary.

**$TOSSY**

**WARNING: DO NOT LOOK AT THIS STOCK IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF HEIGHTS** 

We all know Toshiba. Everyone’s first T.V. First Laptop.  Girlfriend, Etc. But did you know Toshiba is a global leader of perovskite semiconductor applications? In Sept. 2021 $TOSYY announced a breakthrough for producing light, flexible, and efficient perovskite. Basically they found a way to print it with ink for a lot cheaper and a lot faster. $TOSYY has its hand in all manner of semiconductor manufacturing. And they’re perfectly poised for a rapid scale up for wide spread global distribution of perovskite semiconductors. 

First- $TOSYY trades at about $20 a pop. It had a record year. A whopping 45.8% return Y/Y. It’s 5 year? 67%. If you look at the chart you can see $TOSYY is poised for another bull run. It reached resistance at around $23 a share back in April.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lfc1jbafbr981.png?width=1438&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ccc7a13a31e9109a9f045e85e06ccd58b538e06

Now you might say to yourself- hey, I want to be in on Toshiba’s semiconductor business, but they’re laptops aren’t very good. Well I’ve got good news! Back in April, [Toshiba announced it’s spinning off its semiconductor business into](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/news/corporate/2021/11/news-20211112-02.html) DeviceCo as part of a massive restructuring. New shares will be issued for Toshiba shareholders in the second half of 2023. 

That means the pump is PRIMED from $TOSYY as it spins its successful perovskite research and development arm into a business of its own, with $TOSSY still hitting funneling cash its way. 

**If You Need More Proof**

[The Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research has dumped tons of money into perovskite.](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/01/03/army-navy-lend-muscle-to-new-2-d-perovskite-solar-cell-thats-18-more-efficient/) Does the DoD make wrong bets?  

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Perovskites are quickly replacing silicon as the conductor in semiconductors because they’re cheaper, easier to produce, more efficient, and have a wider range of application than silicone. Perovskite work has advanced exponentially in 2021. These companies help put perovskite in semiconductors: $MYBUFF  $AIXXF and  $TOSYY",1641339700

As the leader in Canada with 100+ dispensaries now running with the Costco discount model, I have high confidence that this model will be what turns the company profitable in the near future, alongside their accretive e-commerce acquisitions. I say this because of their vertical integrated accessories business. This is something that does not get talked about enough for $HITI. Manufacturing the bulk of the accessories they sale in-house, it enables them to make up margins when discounting flower to undercut the legal market and take market share from the illicit market. The #1 thing I will be looking for here is how $HITI manages their operational expenses as they continue to open up more stores - WILL BE CRUCIAL!!

As noted previously, $HITI continues to purchase accretive e-commerce assets. Not only do they own the top 3 e-commerce websites for cannabis accessories, but also own subscription company Daily High Club and numerous juggernaut CBD e-commerce companies (FabCBD and NuLeaf in US and Blessed CBD in UK). I am sure they have something in Germany in the works knowing Raj or they will go in there with Blessed CBD. All these companies will add more revenue to $HITI and will easily integrate into their current ecosystem - not adding too many expenses. As management continues to buy up profitable assets that easily integrate into $HITI current infrastructure, economies of scales will be achieved - this will take time... PAYTIENCE. $HITI is setting up their e-commerce systems and processes within the cannabis accessories market and CBD markets globally, so that once flower is legalized in the US and other countries, the systems and processes are already in place to plug in a new product (flower). I believe we will see some positive earnings reports throughout 2022 especially in the second half - REMEMBER THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY! 2023 will be an even better year than 2022.

In addition, all of the proprietary data that $HITI is accumulating with all of these e-commerce assets and the ones they will buy in the future will be something they will leverage as they expand into other geographic areas. They will know what products to start with and what customer profiles to go after to achieve the highest margins. In addition, they already have 250,000+ Canna Cabana members, and this will only continue to grow as consumers in Canada realize how great the deals are compared to competitors - not only on flower but accessories, which we all know are needed to consume cannabis. Another thing I am bullish on with $HITI and all of its online assets is that once online advertising is legalized for cannabis companies (Google ads) it will only help them make more revenue with higher margins as we all know that online marketing - when done right - can help grow companies even more. And don't get me started on how much more revenue $HITI will make once they begin deliveries of cannabis in March!!!

Lastly, when you compare $HITI past 1 year return vs all the MSOS and Canadian LPs, not many companies have weathered the 2021 storm as well as $HITI has. Go to Google Finance or wherever and go to the 1 year chart and compare $HITI returns to other cannabis companies. Most are negative where $HITI has seen a 47.44% gain despite the 2021 accumulation phase. We are near the bottom, we may even see $4 before the next run up but I will just continue accumulating.

We are in a prime time within this accumulation phase. Don't let it go to waste.",1641334913

&amp;#x200B;

first of all, if we look at Brainchip (BRN) website, they throw all the important words into the pot. neural networking, AI, next generation, revolutionary, sensoring, chips, autonomy, AI learning, scalability. thats 10/10 if its true but it can turn into 0/10 real fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

their reddit and linkedin pages look garbage, but that might be due to only 25 (?, source linkedin) employees. so 0/10 here. their website however looks good, 10/10. 

&amp;#x200B;

their financial annual report first third just consists of how much their ceo's make. thats bad. but the rest looks good. revenue up 5600% yoy, net profit margin up 100%, of course in total they loose money but they are a young company. 

&amp;#x200B;

they recently partnered with Daimler Benz to integrate their new hot shit into those G wagons and these grey granny limousines. thats 10/10

&amp;#x200B;

so anyways guys what do u think, any insider who can tell us more?",1641334181

7775,wallstreetbets,EM Call Woes/ Advice Needed,"Started with 5k, went to 30k, and then down to 25k but I purchased things after hours and despite talking to my brokerage for a solid hour before doing so they didn't once explain the ""marked to market"" rule that would give me an EM call for trading after hours. Of course things got worse the next day and I lost more.  I obviously should've known but I got a biology degree not finance, like damn. 

I was so used to having the day trades to exit myself out of bad positions and wait for re-entry but now that luxury is gone and I've found it harder to climb back up and easier to lose. Even the three day trades a week before hitting 25k were amazing emergency exit buttons for losses/profits. Unfortunately, I used a reset already months prior after fat fingering sell instead of buy on my phone. 

I'm super bummed about it so if anyone has stories about heavily dropping below 25k and somehow rising back up without depositing more funds I'd love to here it. Or if anyone has some (serious/original) coaching on trading better I'd be happy for it.

7823,wallstreetbets,CitiGroup (C) is undervalued significantly DD,"**CitiGroup:**

Source: [**https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/12/heres-why-citigroup-is-1-of-the-best-value-stocks/**](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/12/heres-why-citigroup-is-1-of-the-best-value-stocks/)

Highlight: CitiGroup stood out among the big four banks because its focus on developing international markets has helped it establish a dominant position to take advantage of the rapid growth of economic hubs around the world such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. CEO Jane Fraser furthers this advantage through her strategic strategy to cut unprofitable consumer operations across the world and focus investment towards these so called “wealth-centres,” with a particular focus on transaction banking, wealth management and commercial banking.

Long term prospects:

* High ROE (13%) compared to rest of bank industry (11%)
* Citigroup Price to book per share is around 0.80, implying undervaluation
* P/E ratio of around 7 implies undervaluation (strong undervaluation case)
* \~3% dividend yield is higher than other bank stocks like JPM and its strong history of payments makes it a dividend aristocrat
* New management (in response to the regulatory issues) led by Jane Fraser winning back confidence by maintaining compliance and focusing on more profitable ventures  

   * Shifting resources from 13 international markets in the EMEA and Asia and towards 4 high growth cities: Singapore, the Dubai, London, and Hong Kong.
* Diversified revenue streams in investment banking *and* commercial banking has made it more resilient in COVID than other smaller banks (as investment banking operations have fared better during the pandemic/cyclical downturns).  

   * This has been especially beneficial as investment banking operations represent around 60% of CitiGroup’s revenues
   * Focusing on treasury and trade solutions, financial market services, and private banking (wealth management) which have been more profitable

Non-intrinsic value related reasons for undervaluation:

* Long term record of underperformance compared to BAC and JPM (potentially scaring investors away)
* \+$1 Billion in mistakes in 2020 spooked investors. Though, these mistakes aren’t indicative of the company’s financial strength (new leadership under Jane Fraser also aiming to optimize regulatory compliance).
* Banking sector in general undervalued relative to the broader market (possibly due to its safe haven/dividend status being unattractive in a hype driven tech and fintech environment where investors seek growth rather than stability and dividends)  

   * → Possibly leading to wealthier long term investors buying up bank stock for dividends, leading to little market volatility. (Unsure if this is a valid assumption)

Limitations:

* Banks are heavily prone to business cycles as their performance is tied to consumer spending.
* As Dave Ellison a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds, said: “They are just not defined as anything besides a big pile of assets . . . people own it because it’s cheap.” We think this is likely to change given Fraser’s new strategy
* Prone to loan losses/defaults, which are a subset risk of business cycles.
* Interest rate risk: The combination of federal reserve forward guidance of not increasing rates until around 2023 (though it’s important to note that forward guidance is not a guarantee) and predictions that the rate will increase.  

   * Persistently low interest rates (along with a loose monetary policy), are likely to depress the net interest margin (NIM) of banks.  

      * (good side of interest rates) However, if interest rates increase in response to the growing economy (which Robert Kaplan, the influential Dallas Federal Reserve president, says should be done “sooner rather than later”), then banks like CitiBank will have more flexibility to adjust their NIMs to generate more profit (potentially resulting in a broad based profitability of commercial banks).
* Like most other sectors, the traditional (branch based) banking industry is susceptible to disruption especially from fintech players like ally branch.

Source: [**https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/12/heres-why-citigroup-is-1-of-the-best-value-stocks/**](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/12/heres-why-citigroup-is-1-of-the-best-value-stocks/)

Highlight: CitiGroup stood out among the big four banks because its focus on developing international markets has helped it establish a dominant position to take advantage of the rapid growth of economic hubs around the world such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. CEO Jane Fraser furthers this advantage through her strategic strategy to cut unprofitable consumer operations across the world  and focus investment towards these so called “wealth-centres,” with a particular focus on transaction banking, wealth management and commercial banking.

Long term prospects:

* High ROE (13%) compared to rest of bank industry (11%)
* Citigroup Price to book per share is around 0.80, implying undervaluation
* P/E ratio of around 7 implies undervaluation (strong undervaluation case)
* \~3% dividend yield is higher than other bank stocks like JPM and its strong history of payments makes it a dividend aristocrat
* New management (in response to the regulatory issues) led by Jane Fraser winning back confidence by maintaining compliance and focusing on more profitable ventures
   * Shifting resources from 13 international markets in the EMEA and Asia and towards 4 high growth cities: Singapore, the UAE (Dubai), London, and Hong Kong.
* Diversified revenue streams in investment banking *and* commercial banking has made it more resilient in COVID than other smaller banks (as investment banking operations have fared better during the pandemic/cyclical downturns).
   * This has been especially beneficial as investment banking operations represent around 60% of CitiGroup’s revenues
   * Focusing on treasury and trade solutions, financial market services, and private banking (wealth management) which have been more profitable

Non-intrinsic value related reasons for undervaluation:

* Long term record of underperformance compared to BAC and JPM (potentially scaring investors away)
* \+$1 Billion in mistakes in 2020 spooked investors. Though, these mistakes aren’t indicative of the company’s financial strength (new leadership under Jane Fraser also aiming to optimize regulatory compliance).
* Banking sector in general undervalued relative to the broader market (possibly due to its safe haven/dividend status being unattractive in a hype driven tech and fintech environment where investors seek growth rather than stability and dividends)
   * → Possibly leading to wealthier long term investors buying up bank stock for dividends, leading to little market volatility.  (Unsure if this is a valid assumption)

Limitations:

* Banks are heavily prone to business cycles as their performance is tied to consumer spending.
* As Dave Ellison a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds, said: “They are just not defined as anything besides a big pile of assets . . . people own it because it’s cheap.” We think this is likely to change given Fraser’s new strategy
* Prone to loan losses/defaults, which are a subset risk of business cycles.
* Interest rate risk: The combination of federal reserve forward guidance of not increasing rates until around 2023 (though it’s important to note that forward guidance is not a guarantee) and predictions that the rate will increase.
   * Persistently low interest rates (along with a loose monetary policy), are likely to depress the net interest margin (NIM) of banks.
      * (good side of interest rates) However, if interest rates increase in response to the growing economy (which Robert Kaplan, the influential Dallas Federal Reserve president, says should be done “sooner rather than later”), then banks like CitiBank will have more flexibility to adjust their NIMs to generate more profit (potentially resulting in a broad based profitability of commercial banks).
* Like most other sectors, the traditional (branch based) banking industry is susceptible to disruption especially from fintech players like ally branch. However, this limitation is mostly mitigated (especially with respect to citibank) as many banks (especially citibank) are decreasing their branch footprint and ramping up investment in their digital operations.
* Increased banking regulation may hurt banks further, as we have seen from the 2008 financial crisis.
   * One painful example of this is CitiBank’s early 2021 $400 million fine to regulators for failing to keep its internal operations under control which was salt on the wound for when one of its bankers sent \~$900 million to the wrong people 2 months earlier. $504 million is unrecoverable (out of pocket costs)

7843,wallstreetbets,How my husband pretend to be blind because i hade a skin disease,"A man married a beautiful girl. He loved her
very much. One day she developed a skin disease. Slowly. she started to lose her beauty. It so happened that one day her husband left for a tour. While returning he met with an accident and lost his eyesight. However, their married life. continued as usual. But as days passed she lost her beauty gradually. Blind husband did not know this and there was no any difference in their married life. He continued to love her and she also loved him very much. One day she died. Her death brought him a great sorrow. He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town.
A man from behind called and said, ""Now how will you be able to walk all alone? All these days your wife used to help you"". He replied, ""I am not blind. I was acting because if she knew I could see her skin condition due to a disease, it woul have pained her more than her disease. I didn't love her for her beauty alone, but I fell in love with her caring and lovingnature. So I pretended to be blind. I only wanted to keep her happy"".
Moral: When you truly love someone, you will go to any extent to keep your loved one happy and sometimes it is good for us to act blind and ignore one another's short comings in order to be happy. The Beauty will fade with time but heart and soul will always be the same. Love the person for what he/she is from inside, not from outside.",1641327079

7883,wallstreetbets,VXRT IS A GOOD BET," he highly mutated coronavirus variant Omicron might be able to evade the  body’s first line of immune defense but is unlikely to make it through  the second – T-cells, according to the results of a computational study.  


In  a peer-reviewed article published in the journal Viruses on Sunday,  researchers in Hong Kong and Australia said T-cell responses induced by  vaccines, boosters and previous infections could help protect against  severe illness and hospitalization from Omicron.  


But the number  of infections might rise because of Omicron’s ability to evade the first  line of defense – antibodies, which block infection and prevent  transmission.  


“Robust T-cell immunity provides hope that, similar  to other variants of concern, the level of protection against severe  disease would remain high,” said the scientists, from Hong Kong  University of Science and Technology and the University of Melbourne.  


“If  T-cell responses hold up, they are likely to assist in limiting disease  severity in infections caused by Omicron that seemingly escapes  neutralizing antibodies.”  


Although the Phase 1 trial of the VXRT vaccine had a weak antibody response it did HAVE A STRONG T CELL RESPONSE.  


So  even if the Phase 2 data does not show a large increase in antibodies  the T cell response could be the key for success of their program.  


More  and more studies are indicating that T cells may be more important than  antibodies in fighting not only Omicron but future variants as well.  


So even though VXRT is late to the party they may end up having the last laugh.  


In my view the Norovirus and seasonal flu vaccine can be much more important for the future of VXRT.  


I have been skeptical of management but the T cell data is very encouraging for VXRT investors.",1641324764
7884,wallstreetbets,Autonation is a $55 stock,"Leading up to the pandemic this company ($AN) made about $4.50 per year and traded at a multiple of between 8 and 12.  It's not a great growth story.  They have no disruptive technology.  They sell cars.  Car sales over the last couple of years have been  off the charts and they've been making a shit ton of money.  In my mind there is no way that that is going to continue.  There are a number of reasons for this.

The chip shortage is going to be a thing of the past and people will be able to buy new cars again.  That means that the markup on used cars is going to plummet.

Manufacturers aren't going to sit idly by while dealers mark cars up well above the MSRP and make record profits. I've read about the Ford Mach-e being marked up $10,000 and the Mercedes EQS by $50,000.  Already, 12 states have legislation moving forward to allow manufacturers to sell directly to the consumers.  In most cases this only applies to EVs but let's face it, in a few years that's all there's going to be anyway.

[Buyer Rejects $50K Dealer Markup On Mercedes EQS, Gets Lucid Air (insideevs.com)](https://insideevs.com/news/557827/mercedes-eqs-50000usd-dealer-markup/)

Dealers make 49% of their  profits from servicing vehicles they sell.  Electric vehicles require far less service than ICE vehicles.

2022 may be a good year for these guys and they may hit the analysts target of $18 per share profit but after that I see a steady decline in both revenue and profit.  I was criticized for being too wordy with my last post (MRNA is a $30 stock) so I'll cut it off here.

Source: [https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-buy-now/](https://www.investors.com/news/visa-stock-buy-now/)

Highlight: We chose to invest in Visa recognizing its dominant domestic and international position in the lucrative credit processing market and proactive investments in its blockchain related operations.

Non-intrinsic value related reasons for undervaluation:

* Coronavirus has resulted in major damage to ⅓ of Visa’s payments volume: travel, food, entertainment, hospitality (negative demand shock)
* The threat of a delta variant is spooking investors and preventing a true bounceback
* Legal/regulatory risks make investors hesitant (e. Brazilian central bank halting the business’ operations in Brazil)

Why it’s a good long term play:

* Strategy to aggressively expand into the digital space, such as contactless payments and e-commerce likely to be a major revenue driver as retail space dwindles.
   * The rise in e-commerce benefits Visa since Visa’s share of digital commerce is approximately 3 times greater than a point of sale transactions. (according to Visa).
* Now is a good time to get in since global spending is about to bounce back, provided the delta variant doesn’t become substantially worse
* Visa is making bold new moves into the rapidly growing blockchain space, partnering with PayNearby, India’s leading online bank and digital payments network, and RBL Bank to launch SoftPos and mPOS to create a large retail network where contactless payments can be made on smartphones
* First major payments network to accept transactions in USD Coin (first move advantage over competitors in highly competitive market) → piloting done with partnership with C.rypto.com and also doing this by partnering with Anchorage, 1st federally chartered digital asset bank
* Acquired Tink for $2 billion, which will create a network of more than 3,400 banks in Europe with over 250 million customers
* Cronoavrius positive: Movement to tap-to-pay and contactless payments boosting demand for Visa services (shift away from cash payments)
* Rise of buy now pay later stimulating growth of Visa installments (a BNPL program)
* Has greater market share of the payments processing industry than Mastercard, with which Visa makes up a duopoly (around 2 times greater processing volume)
   * Indirect network effects: as Visa payments become more popular, companies have a greater incentive to use Visa payments/software (in addition to the relatively more recognizable/reputable brand name)
* Largest share of revenue is Visa DPS, which has remained the US’ most used processing service of its kind (to process, clear and manage Visa transactions) → Closely tied with market share of Visa cards

Limitations:

* Government regulation (antitrust) cracking down on Visa’s expansion due to duopoly status. This may prevent Visa from acquiring new businesses it sees as worth buying and enabling competitors to take away greater market share
* Rise of competition from other firms in primary transactions business, as well as highly competitive BNPL industry (which Visa is not as dominant in)
* (unlikely/far off): Rise of decentralized money/blockchain currencies take away market share from Visa’s payments processing segment.
   * Visa is proactive in this respect, as evidenced by their acquisition of YellowPepper, a blockchain currency based fintech company.
* Intense competition from digital payment providers like Paypal, which is expanding. This may limit Visa’s potential to grow its digital payments presence, therefore preventing it from reaping the gains of a rapidly growing digital payments industry.

… Even so, we believe the negatives are outweighed by positives.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analyst Price target:**

The 32 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Visa Inc have a median target of $280.60, supporting our claim of undervaluation (current price $230.65). [Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=v) (CNN Money)

From Tipranks (also well reputed): Based on 18 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Visa in the last 3 months. The average price target is **$280.44**. Very similar targets to the CNN money analyst predictions, implying broad based analyst agreement that the stock is currently undervalued. [Source](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/v/forecast)

ESSC is a SPAC that is taking a somewhat unusual path to merger. A vote occurred and during that vote a large amount of the outstanding shares were redeemed. At the same time, the merger date was pushed back to  February 16, 2022. This means that it’s left with an extremely tiny optionable float for ***two months.***

Currently there is a maximum of 341k (previous float) + 850k (from Sea Otter 13G) + 2,073,974 (other Arb Funds shares) = 3,264,974 shares that exist (1.191M of which could now likely be considered tradeable at this moment).  Meaning, that just 11910 options contracts account for the **entire thing**. For reference, IRNT had 1,300,000 shares in its float. Another point is that ESSC has not actually merged yet, while IRNT had. This means that there is no impending PIPE unlocks or dilution on the horizon until February.

After a pullback to near the NAV floor, ESSC began an to accumulate OI on the January options chain. Sentiment appears to be turning around, as RSI continues to rise on the 4 hour chart, and appears to be on the verge of a breakout.

&amp;#x200B;

As of this morning, ITM OI is at **59.4%** of the float , the $12.50 bring it to **176.2%** and the whole chain is up to **260%** of the float. To give an idea of how the OI accumulation has proceeded, I'll post the daily change this week.

This setup is even better than December's, and if you enter at the time of posting you are setting yourself up with a cheaper entry considering how low the IV is currently.

The stock trading near the NAV floor, large accumulation of OI on the options chain, Low IV, Low Float, and with the merger being beyond options expiration, I see this as a Unique opportunity to capitalize on a gamma squeeze setup.

ESSC is probably one of the most *primed* squeezes in the market at the moment and Reddit is almost completely unaware that it exists. Almost a full year after GME and retail is not any better at this than they were then. Now, there is a chance that  nothing comes of it, but I would say that chance is objectively shrinking by the day.

BONUS:If you are looking for a Low risk entry, the 7.5c is trading with little to no extrinsic value, and seeing that the underlying has held a support of 10.60 even after sentiment cooled off, the risk of losing money entering at these levels is minimal even if nothing happens this month so long as the NAV floor is in place.",1641315819
7987,wallstreetbets,Agrify Enters Into a 10-Year Agreement with Gold Leaf For Its Total Turn-Key Solution,"*Over $140 Million in Revenue Expected Over the First Three Years of Cultivation and Over $400 Million in Total Revenue Projected for the 10-Year Term of the Agreement*  


*Expands Agrify’s Footprint to Lucrative and Fast-Growing Florida Cannabis Market*

BILLERICA, Mass., Jan. 04, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agrify Corporation (Nasdaq:AGFY) (“Agrify” or the “Company”), the most innovative and vertically integrated provider of premium cultivation and extraction solutions for the cannabis and hemp industry, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement (the “Agreement”) for its largest Agrify Total Turn-Key Solution (“Agrify TTK Solution”) partnership to date with Gold Leaf Florida LLC (“Gold Leaf”), a leading licensed medical marijuana treatment center based in Myakka City, Florida. The Agreement, which is the first for Agrify in the flourishing Florida cannabis market, is expected to generate more than $140 million in revenue for Agrify over the first three years of cultivation and over $400 million of estimated total revenue over the full 10-year term of the partnership.

Gold Leaf is one of only 22 licensed centers and one of only 16 active operators in Florida, and the organization is planning to open 20 dispensaries in the state by 2024. Medical marijuana treatment centers like Gold Leaf are the only businesses currently authorized to cultivate, process, and dispense low-THC cannabis and medical marijuana in Florida.

Under the terms of the 10-year Agreement, Agrify will be installing 1,510 of its Vertical Farming Units (“VFUs”) at Gold Leaf’s 200,000-square-foot facility, with 100,000 square feet dedicated to VFU cultivation. Gold Leaf plans to build four additional 200,000-square-foot facilities in Florida, for a total of one million square feet, and Agrify hopes to support Gold Leaf through all of this anticipated future growth with the installation of several thousand more VFUs. The initial Agreement also includes architectural and engineering services, recurring SaaS revenue for use of the Agrify Insights cultivation software, operations consulting, and brand licensing. Gold Leaf also has the option to engage with Agrify for construction financing.

Raymond Chang, Chairman and CEO of Agrify, said, “Our partnership with Gold Leaf is a milestone achievement that represents even further validation of our novel TTK program given the scale and economic value of this customer engagement. By partnering with Gold Leaf in the early stages of their organization’s cultivation journey, we will play an instrumental role in helping their team fulfill their mission of supplying the medical market with the quality cannabis and consistent experiences patients and physicians have come to demand.”

Mr. Chang continued, “We are also excited about entering the robust Florida medical cannabis market, the nation’s largest, with a premier partner like Gold Leaf, and we look forward to leveraging our position for additional growth opportunities in this highly attractive market.”

“We are thrilled that Agrify is committed to providing support and extensive training throughout the life of our relationship to ensure we execute against our ambitious growth plans in a thoughtful, precise, and successful manner,” said Mark Seid, Executive Vice President of Gold Leaf. “We believe Agrify’s TTK program will enable us to provide quality product and consistent patient experiences that will give us the competitive edge needed to remain a leader in Florida’s growing medical cannabis market.”

 About Agrify TTK Solution

The Agrify TTK Solution is a first-of-its-kind program in which Agrify partners with qualified cannabis and hemp cultivators in the early phases of their business plans and provides critical support over a 10-year period, which includes: access to capital, design and buildout of their cultivation and extraction facilities, state-of-the-art cultivation and extraction equipment, process design, training, implementation, data analytics, and consumer branding.

To date, the Company has contractual commitments for over 3,000 VFUs that will be powered by the Agrify Insights SaaS cultivation software as well as the value-added services mentioned above. Cumulatively, all of the 10-year agreements under Agrify’s TTK Solution program are currently projected to generate an estimated $850 million in total revenue.

7992,wallstreetbets,Adios Wall Street bets. Thanks for the last eight months.,"Thanks for the memes boiis. I have been on AMC, CLOV, PLTR, GME, RIVIAN….and my final death blow was PFE. It’s kinda funny that my final death blow came from a boomer stock…well technically it’s short term options in a boomer stock so guess that explains why…

The last time I was this depressed , I posted about the market being risky and that one should not put important money. Yet I myself did not practice what I preached so here I am depressed yet again.I have deleted that post if your wondering ; even I can’t handle my cringe. I was basically a clown telling other clowns not to be a clown back then. But now, I am too broke to be a clown anymore so I shall leave with some parting words as an ex clown.

I think by now most of you should know, the stock market in the short term is a casino. And like any casino, it is a game of probability….skewed mostly against you. If your lucky you get a lambo…if not well ramen for life m8. 

For every lambo post there is a guy like me …. Just depressed and accepting their poor reality. If you check my account, you can see I was hopeful and trying up until this very minute. 

I have decided to quit it once and for all cos all this stress and breakdowns is not worth it. All the memes and jokes here is probably what kept my sanity in check so thanks for that boiis. 

My portfolio is now worth 300 bucks when I last checked (before this post). Honestly after all that I have lost , I do not see any point in cutting losses any further so in true wsb fashion gonna let my options  expire worthless 

While expensive, I have nevertheless learnt a lot about how much I lack in my knowledge of investing . So that’s prolly my take away from this 8 month market mayhem 

Anyways thanks for coming to my Ted talk! Stay safe, happy new year and good luck fellas !

Your sincerely, 
An ex clown who will be cheering you guys from the sidelines",1641315271

8116,wallstreetbets,"Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.","Jim Cramer has made 21,609 stock picks in the past 5 years! Let that sink in for a moment. Here is one person, making buy/sell/hold recommendations on more than 2,200+ different stocks across all types of industries. On average, he was making more than 20 picks per episode of his show \[1\]. This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \[2\]

While we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:

1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**
2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**
3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**

So it’s high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!

https://preview.redd.it/ky8qh0nzeo981.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=104b963a012fc82a7a12585615dbd98c402e0a26

**Analysis**

The data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm) \[3\]. The picks are classified into five segments (Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive/Negative mention). I have calculated the return for each segment separately \[4\] so that we can know what to focus on if we are trying to replicate this strategy.

Since Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks and is mainly focused on short-term trades, I am only analyzing the stock returns for the following periods \[5\].

a. One-day

b. One-Week

c. One-Month

Given that Mad Money (Cramer’s Show) airs after the market closes, I have used the opening price of the next day for my calculations. (I.e If Cramer makes a recommendation on Thursday night, I use Friday opening price as the base for my calculations)

All the data used in the calculations are shared at the end.

https://preview.redd.it/yc7i0we0fo981.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1c59f7bb5c02119e674ffaaf079fa67afa6120

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/5ezb3bw1fo981.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb146c04d7e9311751be085f6d21348fafac092

1-day performance of Cramer’s recommendations is excellent! On average, the Buy and Positive mention stocks went up by 0.03 and 0.05% respectively, and sell and negative mention stocks went down by 0.1 and 0.02%.

Another interesting fact is that ***you would not have lost money*** if you followed Cramer’s Buy recommendations. Across the time periods, his Buy recommendations have on average netted you positive returns \[6\]!

His sell recommendations did not pan out so well. Even though they dropped in price the next day, over the next week and month, they returned inline or even better than his buy recommendations!

Given that there is a counter-intuitive trend in the returns, let’s calculate the accuracy of his calls.

https://preview.redd.it/rht12ux2fo981.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c571f5fc7d63fcb095555080320757192129d380

Here I am assigning a call as correct based on price change. If he gives a buy recommendation, I expect the price to go up and vice versa. As we can see from the chart above, his recommendations only do slightly better than a coin-toss. Even this only holds for short-term and buy recommendations with long-term sell recommendation performance dropping below 50% \[7\].

While this narrow edge over the 50% mark can be used by algo-traders who have the ability to trade a large amount of stocks, if you are an average investor listening in on a Cramer show and hear about a stock recommendation, you might as well toss a coin to see if you should invest or not!

Finally, it’s time we pit **Cramer against the market**. Do his recommendations beat the market?

https://preview.redd.it/5fszhew3fo981.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cf5e2c992435a6d8ed36dbed707b11dd4cd30ba

Oh yeah! I was as surprised with the results as you are. I ran the numbers again and then one more time but got the exact same result! Cramer’s Buy recommendations beat the S&amp;P 500 by a factor of 10 for the **one-day time frame**. But, if you held the stocks for anytime longer, you would have underperformed the market significantly.

Before you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (\~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your **1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034** \[8\].

https://preview.redd.it/1xtamkf0fo981.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6b9215c2379524644653c67ff375667c8f0354a

**Limitations of the analysis**

The analysis has some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

1. As the astute among you might have noticed, if you sum up all the stocks used in the analysis it would only come to 18.5k. I removed \~15% of the overall recommendations as either they did not have stock data present in Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage or the price data did not match with the one given on the Mad Money website.
2. The data is obtained from the Mad Money website itself. I haven’t manually verified if the calls recorded on the website are in fact an accurate representation of the calls made by Cramer in his show. The below statement is given in their description and I am taking them on their word.

&gt;We are impartial in our recording and simply log exactly what was said. We do not interpret the calls. If a call is vague or in question we simply won't list it.

https://preview.redd.it/11nzh3f0fo981.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a15a32e373431bc460ce4c082a94ee58e7c392a6

**Conclusion**

No matter the public opinion on Cramer, we can generate excellent 1-day returns following his buy recommendations (even beating the market in doing so!). Whether it’s due to his superior stock picking ability or whether it’s simply due to self-fulfilling prophecy \[9\] (as he has a wide audience who will act on his advice) is yet to be known.

I would bet on the latter as, if the extraordinary one-day returns were in fact due to his superior stock-picking ability, the returns should have held over longer time periods, and also his sell recommendations would not have ended up performing better than his buy recommendations as we are observing here.

It only makes sense to listen to his advice if you are a day-trader or an algo-trader who is trading a large variety of stocks over short periods of time. For everyone else, just sticking to the S&amp;P 500 would give you better returns over the long run!

**Footnotes and existing research**

**\[1\]** For those who don’t know, Cramer makes his picks in a CNBC show called [Mad Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money). Cramer himself defines the show as something which should be used for speculative/high-risk investing and not for your retirement portfolio.

**\[2\]** For comparison purposes, an equity research analyst [covers only 10-25 companies](https://whatforwork.com/jobs/equity-research-analyst-sell-side/).

**\[3\]** It’s not in an easily usable format. I had to parse the data from the webpage using Python (Beautiful Soup) - I have shared all the data used in this analysis as an Excel and Rows file at the end.

**\[4\]** I did not calculate for Hold as he only made 27 hold recommendations, which is lower than what is required for a statistical significance.

**\[5\]** In my [last post about Jim Cramer](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/), there was a lot of controversy around how I calculated the time period. So here is the detailed version about how the time period is considered. For One-Day returns, we are considering that we will purchase the stock the next trading day after the market opens and then sells it at the end of the trading day. For weekly and monthly returns, I am using adjusted closing price since across a week or month there can be stock splits as well as dividends.

**\[6\]** This can also be attributed to the market rally we have experienced over the last 5 years where a large majority of stocks went up.

**\[7\]** 50% benchmark might be controversial with a lot of you (I agree given that if we are in a bull market there is more than a 50-50 chance of a stock going up tomorrow) → My rationale here is standing today looking at a stock, there are only two things that can happen tomorrow. It can either go up or go down. I assign equal probability to both given anything can happen tomorrow. The market can turn bearish, positive or negative news about the company can come up, etc. If you have a better logic for a benchmark, please do suggest!

**\[8\]** But to be fair to Cramer, this is applicable to all types of Investment strategies and hedge funds! The performance of a few of the stocks in your portfolio will finally end up heavily influencing the returns of your overall portfolio. → Think of Tesla incase of ARK and FAANG in case of S&amp;P 500.

**\[9\]** There is some [existing research](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/588) that deep dives into this topic.

**\[10\]** Since it’s a live tracker using data from Alpha Vantage, the calculation is done slightly differently than in the analysis (in the live tracker I had to use the closing price on the day of recommendation instead of the opening price of the next day). I will be updating it to follow the same process as the analysis as soon as I get info from Alpha Vantage.",1641304719

Summary and Personal Thoughts:

I love to workout, and I hate the only places near me are fast food restaurants without healthy options. Hell, McDonalds even discontinued their healthier wraps and salads. This is a great opportunity to invest in a company that aligns with my beliefs. These are the best companies to invest in since they are so easy to hold. The last thing i'll say is this has been missed as a reopening play, the IPO was 4.70 in Feb 2020 and it was immediately CRUSHED by the covid shutdowns in March of 2020. With omnicron it has given an even lower and juicier entry for myself and hedgies.

Scroll through TikTok and all you see are gym bunnies and people working out. With the rise of 'influencers' there could be a strong push towards that being the new norm with the pressure on looks and society. Tin foil here.

**Project Background (gets a bit technical, for geek intended use only):**

A group of friends and I (*MIT and Fortune50 alumni*)  have been working on a context inferential machine. That is a mouthful for sure. What this means though is that we implemented similar techniques currently dominating the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) but made them work for the problem of time series forecasting, which is the domain area of stock pricing. 

**What are we using?**

At the core of our project are deep neural networks, more specifically, we are using transformers to identify and contextualise short term trends. By short term we mean that the window of our inferences views the period 5 to 7 days past the inference date. For example if our inference date is January 3rd then our inference window would be January  10th through January 12th.

Besides the ""very high tech"" transformers, we also dealt with typical software engineering issues like having to collect, process and analyse data for over 5000 companies on a daily basis. 

**Are we predicting the future?**

We are not peddling predictions, nobody can predict the future. Even Renaissance Technology is right only about 51% of the time. Our interest is in contextualising the risk involved in buying a stock for swing trading. 

**Why are we doing this?**

We are passionate about artificial intelligence, math and prudent trading. We understand that lots of people will just want to flock into TSLA calls and diamond hand them GME and Yolo their way into riches or ruin. However, we think that there may be a fraction of people who would just want to make more informed decisions and perhaps don't have the time, technical knowhow or desire to deal with vast amounts of data crunching. If you are in the first group, we love seeing your win porn post!  If you are in this last group, we hope this helps you :)",1641304222

As seen by the link above, Meta has just gotten a new price target from Jeffries at  $420 a share, a whole 24% above it's previous close. This is a pretty substantial increase for a large cap and I think that there will be more PTs to follow suit. FBs shift towards the metaverse is a hugely underrated move which will bring in a whole new crowd of social media users. Facebook for a while has been losing its younger users to platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat but this push to the metaverse will bring them back and then some.

Looking at technicals, FB also seems like it's at a buy point. it recently broke out of long term resistance and is now retesting the newly formed support that was that resistance. It has maintained a short term upward channel during this time. Additionally, it has been consolidating for months now after it's whistleblower leak which means it is primed for a move to the upside with all these positive catalysts coming.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7elfNvxC

A break of the 353 area which seems like the next resistance coming would most likely send FB to all time highs. Once again, this all hinges on general markets staying solvent. I believe they will until the start of February-ish so the play I'm going with here are 1/21 350c's. As always good luck to everyone and I hope you all make some money this year!",1641304136

&amp;#x200B;

SAVAge Ape and Associate Professor of Internal Medicine here. I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. If you squander this opportunity, you deserve it.

**TLDR:**

1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a bear raid. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The SP fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150 days from the date of the accusations (January 19th, 2022). The false assertions cratered the SP, so the question is: what will happen when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic? I anticipate SP recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**
2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \*clinical\* data.**
3. **No Sincere scientist will EVER advocate for stopping research on a safe and promising medication as the shorts are.**

**First** **Math Class:**

SP’s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 66% after allegations

Thirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.

**Complete recovery means the SP will Increase 432%, not 66%.**

**A Quick Recap Of The Data And Wild Stock Runup:**

For this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial ( both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer’s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA’s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the SP went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull.

Why did the market value the data at 5 billion? [Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best:

***""If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer's disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.""***

Put simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data’s significance, as Alzheimer's currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the SP was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that’s when all the drama started, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster since.

But before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam’s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm’s (another competitor) data thus far is worse than Donanemab’s results.

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:**

On August 2021, a coordinated short raid asked the FDA to halt further testing to protect patients (pretending to be “whistleblowers” and hiding their short bet). The bogus claims asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety (the blatant disregard for patients is remarkable as there were NO safety issues, and halting research literally harms patients). Still, the stock collapsed. You might assume the price action signified the |accusations| (err slander) had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won’t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials. Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:

1. The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will Halt trials.
2. The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety.
3. The shorts say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues.
4. But the shorts cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses???

I am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what the shorts are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can’t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this ‘news.’ The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can't stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the SP recovers by or before January 19, 2022, IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don’t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence. Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but im probably not ;)).

**Need More Evidence?**

Ring lead of the shorts himself essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed. Adrian posted this two days ago because he knows the CP will be rejected. LMAO. Sorry, these shorts are getting pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yc70rqxy9o981.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e73d5f6c9994ce23480f7d569236c755bf9f45

You will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue. (let's throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that's what the shorts are trying). Yes, they are trying this. Don't believe me? Read their tweets. A safety assessment was the whole point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under NO circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3. To say we need more data is valid, but to say stop testing the medication is beyond disingenuous and screams an ulterior motive. **No sincere scientist will EVER try to stop research on a safe medication, much less a safe drug with promising data.** If I have ever seen desperation, this has to be it.

**Still More Evidence:**

On November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, ""there are no signs of data manipulation."" SAVA SP increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations.

**Remi The Dimond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Cheif SAVAge):**

SAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It’s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.

[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cortexyme Inc . Here is its insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:

Ready? Okay, the data readout was “primary endpoints were not met” meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason.

Now let’s look at SAVA:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kjv8j3y3ao981.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116f1e277fa4fe6b96ec27f748a03609057045ae

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)

SAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself. **As Peter Lynch said, “Insiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.”**

To reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won’t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. That date will be on/or before January 19th, 2022.

**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**

There will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that's what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY's protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (march-ish).

SAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.

Other potential drivers of price action include:

* A SI of 40%. (ATH’s)
* A float of less than 40 million.
* A cult-like investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)

All this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.

[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)

Why did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. The shorts will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western bloat says (pre-clinical data). Simufilams CLINICAL data is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why the shorts shift the narrative here: “[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).”

**Simufilam's data shows it is:**

**1). Safe**

**2) Effective**

**3) Desperately needed by Alzheimers patients.**

**Before shorts attack the integrity of the Cognition data:**

It was collected over sixteen clinical sites, across the US and Canada, by physician principal investigators and their associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The FDA maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded). CRA’s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way…

Long-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the SP over 750 within two years. I didn't accidentally add too many zeros. Here is a full breakdown of TAM and why [SAVA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-sava-may-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity.) is so valuable. A common psychological phenomenon is a disbelief resulting in rejection of simple math. Don’t be that fool. It’s simple math, so look it over with an open mind.

I must always share my favorite summary of how much the market values Alzheimer's treatment.

***On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication, and the market cap increased by $17 billion in one day. Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).***

SAVA's market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point, as I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I’ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.

&amp;#x200B;

SAVAge Ape and Associate Professor of Internal Medicine here. I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. If you squander this opportunity, you deserve it.

**TLDR:**

1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a bear raid. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The SP fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150 days from the date of the accusations (January 19th, 2022). The false assertions cratered the SP, so the question is: what will happen when the FDA, the principal governing body of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic? I anticipate SP recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**
2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \*clinical\* data.**
3. **No Sincere scientist will EVER advocate for stopping research on a safe and promising medication as the shorts are.**

**First** **Math Class:**

SP’s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 66% after allegations

Thirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.

**Complete recovery means the SP will Increase 432%, not 66%.**

**A Quick Recap Of The Data And Wild Stock Runup:**

For this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial ( both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer’s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA’s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the SP went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull.

Why did the market value the data at 5 billion? [Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best:

***""If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer's disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.""***

Put simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data’s significance, as Alzheimer's currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the SP was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that’s when all the drama started, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster since.

But before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam’s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm’s (another competitor) data thus far is worse than Donanemab’s results.

**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:**

On August 2021, a coordinated short raid asked the FDA to halt further testing to protect patients (pretending to be “whistleblowers” and hiding their short bet). The bogus claims asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety (the blatant disregard for patients is remarkable as there were NO safety issues, and halting research literally harms patients). Still, the stock collapsed. You might assume the price action signified the |accusations| (err slander) had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won’t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials. Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:

1. The FDA is the ONLY governing body for human/clinical trials that will Halt trials.
2. The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety.
3. The shorts say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues.
4. But the shorts cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses???

I am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what the shorts are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can’t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this ‘news.’ The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can't stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the SP recovers by or before January 19, 2022, IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don’t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence. Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but im probably not ;)).

**Need More Evidence?**

Ring lead of the shorts himself essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed. Adrian posted this two days ago because he knows the CP will be rejected. LMAO. Sorry, these shorts are getting pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g1q9xds7o981.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09ac4b2c09cb7b563cd2ac7a97688c0662af8e11

You will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue. (let's throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that's what the shorts are trying). Yes, they are trying this. Don't believe me? Read their tweets. A safety assessment was the whole point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under NO circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3. To say we need more data is valid, but to say stop testing the medication is beyond disingenuous and screams an ulterior motive. **No sincere scientist will EVER try to stop research on a safe medication, much less a safe drug with promising data.** If I have ever seen desperation, this has to be it.

**Still More Evidence:**

On November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, ""there are no signs of data manipulation."" SAVA SP increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing body (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations.

**Remi The Dimond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Cheif SAVAge):**

SAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It’s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.

[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like CRTX. Here is CRTX insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:

Ready? Okay, the data readout was “primary endpoints were not met” meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason.

Now let’s look at SAVA:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3zbnfxf08o981.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58cdf1c9c9aa4e2869d524b43f65de0f98e7b963

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)

SAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself. **As Peter Lynch said, “Insiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.”**

To reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won’t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. That date will be on/or before January 19th, 2022.

**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**

There will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that's what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY's protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (march-ish).

SAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.

Other potential drivers of price action include:

* A SI of 40%. (ATH’s)
* A float of less than 40 million.

All this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.

**I have more wrinkles than these degenerate smooth brains and rock-solid erections, so what do you have, Professor?**

8145,wallstreetbets,Will this effect pot stocks? Clarence Thomas says federal laws against marijuana may no longer be necessary.,"I'm sure I am not the only one who seen this yesterday, but Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas says federal laws against marijuana may no longer be necessary.

This seems like a step in the right direction, and him being a vocal conservative Judge recognizing this seems to hold more weight to me.

Idk wondering what you guys think

8150,wallstreetbets,Buying $150 each week of undervalued stocks,"Complete retard here. I’m saving up  money to move in with my girlfriend at the end of July. $135 a week is about what I would need, but in case I mess up I’m going to be putting $150 into it. I currently make about $2,000 a month working at a gas station. I’m going to DoorDash for a 2nd job while going to college. My rent is $1,087, my electric is $125, my bills are about $525. My gasoline cost is about $120 an usually my groceries cost me about $50 a month. Before DoorDashing I would only have $93 left over. I do get paid tomorrow, but as of right now I have $1 in my bank account. 
I know this is completely stupid an extremely risky to basically make my savings account my investment portfolio, but really what choice do I have? If you don’t generate capital in a capitalist system then you can never get ahead.
I’m going to try to have some fun with my piss poor reality. Each week until I move out in July, I’m going to be buying $150 worth of different stocks, using different techniques an I will be selling them all at the end of July.
Here are the current shares I have:
NAKD - 7 shares - $5.40
PROG - 16 shares - $2.25
PTON - 1 Share - $35.20
SIRI - 2 Shares - $6.36
BIOL - 4 Shares - $0.42

Wish me luck, I will detail my journey each week

8166,wallstreetbets,Price target,"  

In a previous post I used Technical Analysis to give you an estimate of the price target of NVAX shares in 2022. This was about 220 based on recent price action and support-resistance levels.

I thought it might be useful to see if this price was supported by fundamentals. 

Based on the latest consensus estimates, NVAX is expected to report $1.39B of revenue in FY2021 and $4.49B in FY2022. This is  a downward revision from previous estimates in October 2021 to take into account manufacturing delays.

Considering that a P/S ratio of 4 is a conservative (low) value for vaccine and other Pharmaceutical stocks ( MRNA has a P/S ratio of 9.2, BNTX P/S=4, PFE P/S=4.3) then a price of 240 would be a fair value for NVAX in 2022. This is derived by dividing 240 by the projected 2022 sales per share.",1641298598

Bigly yuge for your consideration.,"thesis: DWAC is following a classic penny stock pump-and-dump play except with 1bn PIPE plus 287m from the SPAC in play. Likely Trump is using this scheme to juice his fanatical base, and pay off his cronies.

stay safe bros. This smart guy on youtube points out some interesting stuff he read in a bloomberg article. Dilution via variable shares. PIPE investors are able to dump shares immediately(big red flag)

may be setting up the biggest pnd of all time. idk. sequence of events could go like this:

primary catalyst: Midterm elections November 8,2022. Trump said he'd probably wait to announce his intention to run for POTUS 2024 until after the midterms.

DWAC/TMTG Merger occurs. magahype train goes through the roof driving the stock to all time highs. PIPE investors unload their shares on the fanatical base. (they baked it in the ability to sell asap, see above)

since there is no evidence that TMTG is a real company, we are also forced to consider the possibility that retail investors will be holding the bag and a shell company with some shitty opensource app cobbled together.

If TMTG is a real company, which is also possible, trump cannot run without a media presence, and he literally cannot log into twitter or FB rn. will undoubtedly use it to communicate with his base, and maybe the company will become profitable. idk.

absolutely smells like a classic pennystock pump-and-dump, but will billions of dollars.

my purpose in writing this is that the previous October action with DWAC was NOT the pump, that was the prepump foreplay. the MAGA-pump is coming up this novemeber. I wanted to bring it to the attention of this room, because like you -I too enjoy a dumpsterfire.

If you have been watching Himx but were waiting for a pullback now is your chance to join this money maker. If your already in Himx now is your chance to extend you play.

8207,wallstreetbets,Why does this financial advisor own so much $PINS?,"Curious if anyone can explain why Baltimore Washington Financial Advisors (BWFA) [disclosed in October](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555486/000160658721001328/xslForm13F_X01/form13InfoTable.xml) that it owns over 725 million shares of $PINS? At a prevailing price of \~$36 per share, that's a total value of about $26.1 billion dollars, which seems to be more than the company's current market cap of $23.75B. How is this possible?

8226,wallstreetbets,Last night and this morning: U.S. stocks 2022 had a scare to open! Tesla rises 13% higher----For sharing.,"**Overseas markets**

1. U.S. stocks open the door in 2022! Dow index and S&amp;P are at new highs

France's CAC 40 index rose 0.90%, Spain's IBEX 35 index rose 0.63%.

4. OPEC + meeting is approaching U.S. oil closed 1.2% higher on Monday

Royal Bank of Canada capital markets analysts led by Helima Croft wrote in a research note published Monday, ""While the number of infections from the mutated strain of Omicron continues to climb in important areas, concerns about crude oil demand may be contained in the near term as no broad embargo restrictions have been adopted.""

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures for February delivery rose 87 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $76.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

5. Gold futures closed down 1.6% on Monday, the lowest closing price in two weeks

U.S. stocks and U.S. Treasury yields climbed on the first day of the new year, sending gold futures prices down to their lowest level in two weeks.

""The gold market is battling the negative sentiment that led it to fall 3.6% in 2021,"" Zaner Institutional analysts wrote in a market commentary on Monday.

Gold futures for February delivery fell $28.50, or 1.6 percent, to close at $1,800.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close since Dec. 21. The intraday low was $1,798.20.

6. U.S. Treasury yields soared market expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates rose

U.S. Treasury yields soared on the first trading day of 2022, as investor optimism about the economy pushed up U.S. stocks, spurred corporate bond issuance and bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least three times this year.

Benchmark yields climbed across the board, led by the policy-sensitive 5-year Treasury yield, which rose nearly 8 basis points to 1.34%. 2-year Treasury yields topped 0.79%, the highest level since March 2020.

**International Macro**

1. despite the rise in interest rate hike expectations U.S. short-term Treasury bids for the first time this year still received the strongest demand since 2010

On the first trading day of 2022, U.S. Treasury yields spiked across the board as rising economic optimism boosted U.S. equities, attracted a large number of corporate bond issues and boosted expectations for at least three interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.

Based on current interest rate futures prices, the federal funds rate target is expected to rise for the first time in May and is expected to increase by 77 basis points by the end of the year.

Jefferies economist Thomas Simons said the rate hike is expected to be a hot topic.

2. The number of new cases of new crowns in the United States is at a record high, but testing data suggest the actual situation may be much more serious

According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of new cases averaged about 405,000 on a single day over the past week, about 60 percent higher than the U.S. peak back in January 2021. But the number of tests reported by states is still below the 2021 peak.

Meanwhile, the PCR test positivity rate was 17 percent, the highest since April 2020.

The data suggest that many cases of omicron are not being detected as it rages, possibly because people are doing their own rapid testing at home or not doing any testing at all.

3. OPEC+ is likely to increase production again as oil market supply is expected to be tighter than previously forecast

OPEC+ representatives said Tuesday's meeting is expected to approve another modest production increase of 400,000 barrels per day, restarting capacity that was temporarily taken offline during the New Crown outbreak.

At a preliminary meeting on Monday, OPEC analysts lowered their forecast for excess oil market supply in the first quarter as rival supplies are expected to weaken.

OPEC and its allies have so far restored about two-thirds of the capacity they suspended in 2020. They are seeking to restore remaining capacity at a pace that just meets the recovery in oil demand, avoiding a price spike or sending the market into a new slump. So far they have had the desired effect, with international crude prices nearing $78 a barrel.

According to a report available, the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee is now forecasting a surplus supply of 1.4 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2022, about 25 percent less than it predicted a month ago.

The committee believes that the impact of the omicron variant is expected to be ""mild and short-lived"" as ""the world becomes better equipped to deal with the new crown epidemic and the challenges it presents.

4. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration: the development of a new crown vaccine specifically for omicron strain is not necessary

Peter Marks, director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which evaluates new crown pneumonia vaccines, said on Jan. 3 local time that the development of a new crown vaccine specifically for the Omicron strain may not be necessary.

Marks said that although all vaccine development companies are working to develop an effective vaccine against the Omicron strain, it is not yet known whether the Omicron strain will remain the main prevalent strain in the New Crown pneumonia outbreak as time goes on.

5. Erdogan's first ""report card"" of the new monetary policy: CPI soared 36% year-on-year to a new high of nearly two decades

On Monday, local time, Turkey's official statistics institute released the country's December CPI data. Stimulated by the new monetary policy, the country's price index saw a rare 13.58 percent year-over-year increase, pulling the annualized inflation rate to a staggering 36.08 percent.

Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner of Istanbul-based Spinn Consulting, said in a media interview that in the face of such an emergency, the benchmark interest rate should be raised sharply and quickly, but the Turkish central bank is unlikely to take action at the moment.

So when the impact of official policies on prices (such as a 50% increase in the minimum wage, etc.) takes hold, the annualized increase in inflation could touch 40%-50% in March this year.

6. Turkey ordered exporters to convert 25% of their income into lira

Turkey's central bank said in a decree on Monday that once exporters receive payments in dollars, euros or pounds, the central bank will buy 25 percent of them.

7. Italy's public administration minister: the country's manufacturing purchasing managers index grew for 18 consecutive months

Local time on January 3, the Italian Minister of Public Administration Brunetta revealed that the country's manufacturing purchasing managers index in December 2021 was 62, has been stable in the rising range for 18 consecutive months, and Italy's GDP is expected to grow by 6.3% in 2021.

8. The United States and Europe Omicron cases ""vertical growth"", many countries refused to tighten the epidemic prevention, foreign media: ""the world is flooded by Omicron""

In the past week, the United States highest single-day new confirmed cases of nearly 700,000 cases, again shaking the world.

In the world's latest ranking of confirmed cases or deaths of new coronary pneumonia, most of those at the top are American and European countries, which is also known as the world's most alarming ranking. In the face of a continuously worsening epidemic, many Western countries are unexpectedly relaxing quarantine regulations

**Company News**

1. Apple closed up more than 2% on Monday to hit a record high, with market capitalization surpassing the $3 trillion mark for the first time during the session

Shares of Apple Inc. closed up 2.5 percent at $182.01 on Monday, a record high, with a market capitalization of $2.98 trillion. The company's total market capitalization surpassed the $3 trillion mark for the first time, becoming the first company ever to reach the milestone.

2. Tesla closed up more than 13% on Monday, with record fourth-quarter deliveries

Tesla shares closed up 13.53 percent at $1,199.78 on Monday, the biggest gain since March last year, with a market value of $1.2 trillion.

The company delivered 308,600 vehicles worldwide in the fourth quarter of last year, setting a new record for the electric car maker and capping off a year in which the company joined the exclusive trillion-dollar market cap club.

3. Guggenheim: Bullish on Nike's entry into meta-universe listed as top stock pick for 2022

Guggenheim named Nike as a ""top stock"" for 2022 on Monday.

In a report to clients, analyst Robert Drbul said Nike's already dominant market share should continue to grow as the company continues to expand its online presence and launch new footwear and apparel products in the new year.

He said Nike should be able to meet the financial targets set last June, despite the recent impact of global supply chain disruptions.

4. ""Dalio's successor"" and a change of crop, Bridgewater Fund announced the CEO position change

The latest personnel changes, also in charge of $ 150 billion in assets of Bridgewater once again face the issue of succession under scrutiny.

Since Dalio, who turned 72 this year, quit the fund's day-to-day management in 2011 to focus on investment research, five people have come and gone in the position until McCormick became the solo CEO in 2019.

For Bridgewater's new management, the biggest difficulty is still how to improve the company's investment performance and retain clients.

8232,wallstreetbets,ICPT - All or (almost) nothing,"ICPT has a mixed history. 

On the one hand, the shares jumped from the low to mid 20s to over $400 in 2014 on the belief that they would be the first to market with a treatment for NASH. 

Since that time, the share price has cratered, with a present price of ~$17 per share; however there's more to it than what meets the eye.

The company has had 2 back-to-back cash flow positive quarters (Q2,Q3, 2021), with sales of their only approved drug (Ocaliva - a second line treatment option for PBC) expected to be around $370mm for 2021.

They also restructured their debt and completed a $75 million share buyback. 

The company has battled with the FDA over the years, most recently receiving a complete response letter for the application to expand the label on Ocaliva to include treating NASH, as well as a Blackbox Warning, limiting the drug from being used by a certain subgroup of patients due to toxicity. 

With all that said, I believe there is something very important to consider about their present and projected revenues. How does a company with a second-line treatment for an uncommon disease generate so much revenue? 

I believe that doctors are prescribing Ocaliva off label in patients suffering from NASH.

ICPT has 2 data readouts coming in Q1 and Q2, for there REVERSE and REGENERATE trial, respectively. 

I believe that the present stock price does not take the possibility of success into account, given that the market cap is around 500 million (about 130m higher than annual revenue guidance for 2021), whereas the NASH market is easily $10 billion +.

While the company has struggled to convince the FDA, at no point did the FDA reject their application - they simply requested more data on long term outcomes and safety, which is why ICPT is putting together the largest data package in the history of NASH research. 

I expect the stock to rocket to $50+ per share on average data, and to go to $100+ on strong data. 

If all goes decently well with both trials, this should be a $150+ stock by the end of 2022, as well as a worthy buyout candidate for big pharma. 

The stock is heavily shorted, so good news should cause a sharp reaction from the market.

If I'm wrong, this will likely fall below its 52 week low of $11.60, and maybe eventually settle in the $12-$15 range while they restructure (reduce R&amp;D spending and continue to focus on selling Ocaliva to PBC patients). 

Theoretically, the stock price should be higher on current sales alone, assuming they were to stop all trial spending and downsize; but I have no idea.

This is not financial or investment advice of any kind. 

Best of luck,

8241,wallstreetbets,NAKED SHORTING IN PSFE IS REAL.,"According to filings today, PSFE major investors held &gt;50% shares and their 3rd biggest investor, Cannae Holdings has added another 5.5m together with the 3m management have added. This adds up to 10% of the float that insiders have added since the drop in Q3 ER.

During Q3 ER, 250m shares were dropped to tank PSFE 40% down. Given the filings now, we know that no major investors have sold off any positions, but added instead. Thats would imply except for the major investors, everyone who held PSFE shares had divested. And if you include the sell down all the way from $19, there simply isnt enough shares to go around. 60m shares used in Q1, another 60m in Q2 and 260m shares in Q3 + the daily short ladder attacks. We also know that retails have been averaging down and accumulating on the way down. 

Blackrock has added 13m shares from open market while Vanguard and Geode has also added in a lesser fashion. Given insiders and retails are accumulating shares on the way down, one would wonder where does all these sales of shares came from? The trading volume simply doesnt tally with the float available. Chairman Bill Foley currently holds 24m shares, 18m units, and 65m shares through Cannae, which total at around 107m shares, tgt with the 155m shares CVC and 123m shares Blackstone has. If all these giant funds are adding at these levels, would beg the question which hedge fund is behind this naked shorting. 

Furthermore, valuations simply dont make sense given gross profit of 60+% and growth in transactional volume and first mover advantage in the US igaming space. PSFE currently has 400m+ EBITDA and FCF, most companies are trading at around 25x (also iterated by Bill Foley during Cannae Conference and Izzy Dawood, the CFO) which would put it at a 10b Market Cap for fair valuation, a &gt;3x upside. CFO has openly said that he and management has been buying more shares since Q2, tgt with recent Cannae filings are incredibly bullish. Peers are trading at 25x to 100x EBITDA. 

Technical wise, PSFE has rebounded from its lows of 3.1 and double bottomed at 3.8 forming a short and long term reversal structure. A break above 5 would fill the gap to 8 and another to 14. Held since 12 and have been averaging down since. Will be adding more given all these new information. I believe we can win the crooked hedge funds naked shorting this yet again.",1641279925

8253,wallstreetbets,$ZIP: set up for a massive run in 2022,"Zip Recruiter ($ZIP) is a mispriced stock. I'm not  a professional stock analyst and not giving investment advice, but the data below has me wondering why ZIP is currently trading for $25. Look at these charts and make your own conclusion. The stock is fundamentally underpriced, and it's going to moon after the next earnings call.

1. **ZIP is an extremely high growth company, but the stock is getting no love**

* The reason zip recruiter is growing so much is driven by the “great resignation”, and employees leaving their jobs to go find better jobs. This is a trend that isn’t going to go away in 2022
* If ZIP hits their Q4 guidance, their YOY growth rate will be 75%. I think Q4 guidance is way too low (see point #2), and my guess is that the company will be over 80% growth for 2021
* In the world of software, there are only a few publicly traded companies growing revenues faster than 70% year over year… in my analysis, I only found 3 comparable companies (SNOW, BILL, S)
* The three companies below having insane growth are all much bigger, and have significantly  higher valuations. Enterprise value multiples are all at least 10-30x greater than ZIP
* The average software company under $10B market cap is growing at 18%, but has a 10x enterprise value/revenue multiple
* If ZIP had the same EV/Rev multiple of it’s slower growing peers, it would be a $70-$100 stock
* Why does ZIP get no love? Tough to say. They just went public this year via direct listing, their market cap is a rounding error compared to other software companies, not many analysts follow them… regardless, they won’t stay under the radar for too much longer

**2. ZIP is always cautious on revenue guidance, but then they deliver huge beats. Q4 will be no different (earnings release will be early Feb)** 

* The chart below shows quarterly revenue by quarter… Q2 2020 was the bottom of the pandemic, but you can see that revenues have steadily grown each quarter
* The orange bars are the company’s guidance… ZIP always set the bar extremely low, and then crushes with actual results
* The company guided Q4 revenue for $209M, which is actually less than Q3 revenues of $213M… a simple trend line would estimate Q4 revenues between $230-$240M
* When ZIP beat posted revenue of $213M in Q3 against guidance of $188M, the stock jumped 13% that trading day
* ZIP will report early February, and with their current price around $25, the stock will blow up (assuming that it stays steady in January)

**3.  But what about profitability? In this time period of rising inflation, don’t investors want to see positive margins?**

* ZIP is profitable on a GAAP basis... In Q3 ZIP posted net income of $22M on revenues of $213M, for healthy margins of 10.3%
* Snowflake, bill.com and SentinelOne are all nowhere near profitability
* ZIP is a rare company delivering growth &gt;70% AND profitability 

**4. The macro economic environment is setting ZIP up to do very well in 2022**… people are leaving their jobs at a record number, and companies are struggling to hire. High inflation times will force companies to pay more for good talent... thus, ZIP can actually pass the inflation on to their customers (companies looking to hire) and they could be relatively unaffected by inflation 

**5. TL/DR… buying ZIP for $25 a share is a steal; after next earnings call and once the company gets more attention, the stock could easily double or triple in 2022**

**6. Positions or ban:** Yes... I heavily believe this thesis and have been buying shares all of 2021. I’m long 2500 shares and also long call options at $25 expiring in Jan

Over the past 2 years (since I've grown my collection of ticker data) - there's been 1.4M instances on a 1Minute basis of arbitrage like this. Essentially, it's the ability to calculate ""Money prices"" that show arbitrage opportunities in a stock's intra-day price action before spot price is inclined to ""fill"" said money price -- The most ideal opportunities are those where a money price is &gt; stock HOD, or money price &lt; stock LOD.

8355,wallstreetbets,We're fcked. Diversify your risk!,"I really don't give a crap about arguing with people wearing rosy shades.  We're seriously fcked as a society. 

1.  Control of people -  Our governments are gaining evermore power on people.  The pandemic has given all governments significant control of population with almost everyone abiding.  Lockdowns, vaccination mandates, passports...precedents in our ""free"" countries.

2.  Control of Thought &amp; Information - Our media and big tech is almost a universally controlled narrative.  How are the narratives the same across most tv news media, print media, social media.  Social media not only directs only your ""preference"" towards you further strengthening your opinions, it is also significantly increasing control of information.  Censorship is real now.  Power of media is being ultimately controlled by fewer and bigger monopolies.  Our governments can gain power easier by controlling this as well.  Media can control our thought.

3.  Fiat Disaster - Our public financials are a damn disaster EVERYWHERE!  Fed printing 30%+ of all US money supply just since the pandemic, and 68% since 2008.  Every damn central bank is the same.  Governments incurred huge debt everywhere.   Wonder why inflation?   We will be wiping our asses with Fiat currency soon.  At 0% interest rates, our ONLY solution can be to print more money...we will never have a balanced budget again.  A company in as deep as a hole as G7 Nations, would collapse like a Chinese property developer.  It only gets worse every year.

4. Anger -  Division is getting deeper and deeper.  Every year it gets worse.  There is always more division now than 2 or 4 years ago.  People don't care about others.  Social media has made this worse by reinforcing opinions.  Globally countries are at odds and an angry population invites governments into unreasonable actions.


I seriously don't think people understand that we are on our way to some serious shit going down.  If these things get a little worse, it could be the beginning of a war.

I think stocks will provide some protection to any failure of fiat currencies, but I don't know how much...

I've never considered holding any ... ever.  Central banks can turn on a dime and make them illegal.  But fuck it and fuck them.  Fuck media, fuck tech, fuck hedge funs and fuck the SEC who doesn't give a fuck about market manipulates.

Okay so remember when GameStop squeezed and for almost no explicable reason Robinhood halted all buying and selling of the stock? The betrayal could not be more ironic. Robin Hood, a tale we’ve all heard before. The noble warrior does what is right by stealing from the rich and helping the poor who otherwise would be helpless in such a society. The sad truth is that Robinhood not only kept many from placing live changing trades, but they demonstrated to the common man that there is no reason to trust anyone on wallstreet, even those who try so hard to appear trustworthy by having the audacity to name their company something as deceiving as Robinhood.

8395,wallstreetbets,Omicron and B.1.640.2 causing demand-surge. Market HEDGE-setup [DD],"As we know Omicron is spreading dramatically in the US, with an ATH-daily high (1.4M cases as published). Not to mention B.1.640.2 (worse than Omicron), which could burst and peak within some months. I'm not trying to make the story longer than needed, but I've got some personal network within a sector and industry that sees peak-covid demand (located in US). I'm talking about the healthcare-daily product &amp; protective gear sector. As stated this supply acceleration will be displayed in upcoming quarters. Why? If you put the pieces together you will understand where we are heading; with mask mandate implemented again, super-high tension on hospitals, more spreading, etc. Businesses won't quit masks for long, risking sickness within their company. Masks will return if not already done. 

From this information, I have concluded that there are some potential good plays out there. Myself is interested in ALPHA PRO TECH **\[$APT\]** or LAKELAND INDUSTRIES **\[$LAKE\]**. All these are trading on post-covid numbers, as the previous 2 quarters have been lighter (due to slow-spreading) + supply-chain during the first wave. Mask plays such as APT, with a bigger product line than just masks, are trading below 6 P/E (as published), decent option-chain, good short-squeeze setup, good board, better funds. 

I could continue to write pages about the current state, outlook, and proof of acceleration within this sector. However, I want to keep it short and simple; the Market is currently moving into a tough area + overall condition. If omicron continues to spread, causing a chaotic, this sector will be a HEDGE just like it were during the first phase and delta. Do your DD and look into these names before it's too late. Although I want to mention that: these are merely SOME plays out there, there's plenty more, for instance insurance. Therefore feel free to share your plays and future outlook.

I'm not trying to make the story longer than needed, but I've got some personal network within a sector and industry that sees peak-covid demand (located in the US). I'm talking about the *healthcare-daily product &amp; protective gear* sector. As stated this supply acceleration will be displayed in upcoming quarters. Why? If you put the pieces together you will understand where we are heading; with mask mandate implemented again, super-high tension on hospitals, more spreading, etc. Businesses won't quit masks for long, risking sickness within their company. Masks will return if not already done. 

From this information, I have concluded that there are some potential good plays out there. Myself is interested in ALPHA PRO TECH **\[$APT\]**, LAKELAND INDUSTRIES **\[$LAKE\]**, and ALLIED HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS **\[$AHPI\]**. All these are trading on post-covid numbers, as the previous 2 quarters have been lighter (due to slow-spreading) + supply-chain during the first wave. Mask plays such as **APT**, with a bigger product line than just masks, are trading below 6 P/E (as published), decent option-chain, good short-squeeze setup, good board, better funds. 

I could continue to write pages about the current state, outlook, and proof of acceleration within this sector. However, I want to keep it short and simple; the Market is currently moving into a tough area + overall condition. If omicron continues to spread, causing a chaotic, this sector will be a HEDGE just like it were during the first phase and delta. Do your DD and look into these names before it's too late. Although I want to mention that: these are merely **SOME** plays out there, there's plenty more, for instance, insurance. Therefore feel free to share your plays and future outlook.

8400,wallstreetbets,Is Coinbase the best cryptocurency/NFT/Metaverse stock?,"Hey everyone, 

I am extremely bullish on the sector of cryptocurency/nft/metaverse and I cannot wait to see things develop! Unfortunately I am not very tech savy so I already gave up trying to set up wallets and all the complications that come with it all trying to acquire NFT's and such. As much as I am bullish I found the best way for myself to gain exposure was through stocks such as Funko for example. 

But as of late I absolutely want as much exposure to it all as possible through stocks. Not only some nft or some blockchain exposure but to cover as much of the sector as I can in 1 or 2 stock picks. 

Which stock covers the cryptocurency/NFT/Metaverse realm the best? Or would anyone be able to recommend up to 2 to blend it in somewhat nicely? 

Thank you so much for your help!",1641259713

8403,wallstreetbets,Why AMC should adopt the higher education pricing model,"Let's say you run a small mom and pop theater chain.  You're making _decent_ money selling out tickets at $10 a pop.  But then Covid happens. And then you flash your junk on a live stream.  

Somehow you survive and want to make a shit ton of money.  So everyone tells your theaters look dingy AF, floors are super sticky and your descriptive audio headphones look like they are from the 80s. 

Well lucky for you [Grand Pappa Silber figured it out](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/education/edlife/how-to-raise-a-universitys-profile-pricing-and-packaging.html)  . TL;DR: you want your shit to look good? Make it so expensive AF.   

Which of these sounds like a nicer theater:
Theater A: $10 / ticket. $6 / popcorn

OR

Theater B: $100 / ticket, $25 / popcorn

OR

Theater C: $10,000 / year long subscription, $56 / use popcorn fee, not optional, $400 cleaning fee (not optional)  


We all know that C is GOING to be the best.

If you're looking at A and saying ""This is the one"" good for you! on finishing that community college degree!

If you're looking at B then congrats on your college's football record!




You might be saying ""well wait, why would anyone pay $10k a year to see the same shit you can see for $4 at the mom and pop theater?""  Well to you I ask: Why would people pay $70k / year to ""attend"" classes online when the content is the exact same shit you can get on YouTube for free?

TL;DR: The more expensive something is; the better it is.

8405,wallstreetbets,DD - What are Dark Pools and how do they work?,"Tonight, I found myself watching level 2 data for a certain ticker and noticed a LARGE portion of the time&amp;sales orders were designated as TRF (Trade Reporting Facility), and the remaining portion was designated as NAS (NASDAQ).  When orders went through, TRF trades did NOT affect the order book.

So naturally, my question was ""WTF is TRF???""

Well, it appears that TRF is where entities report off-exchange trades to the NYSE.  If you want to do your own DD, here is a link to the reporting format for TRF orders
[NYSE_TRF_Messaging_Spec](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse/NYSE_TRF_Messaging_Spec.pdf)

Upon looking into the spec, I was flagged by all the recent changes were implemented by a ""Bryan Tobin""

Bryan Tobin is a manager at NYSE Chicago and has been submitting all the changes since 2015.
Here is the 
[NYSE Chicago Location](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/Citadel+Enterprises+America's+LLC,+South+Dearborn+Street,+Chicago,+IL/@41.8800351,-87.637736,16z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x880e2cbcb2674a9d:0x424899df3c9d2a63!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x880e2cbf4c6c02cd:0xf04e48e640a6f2a8!2m2!1d-87.6375316!2d41.8803115!1m5!1m1!1s0x880e2cbca3176469:0xb50c07f9bb38b9c1!2m2!1d-87.6291641!2d41.8797542)

If you look through the change revisions, there was one in particular that stood out to me... change 4.5 ""TradeModifier2 = 7 Qualified
Contingent Trade; changed from
FINRA contingent trade""

So, what is a qualified contingent trade (QCT) and why does it matter?
Prior to 2008, QCTs required trades to be minimum 10,000 shares or $200,000 in value.
[Order 34-57620](https://www.sec.gov/rules/exorders/2008/34-57620.pdf) removed that limitation, now not having any size requirements since according to the order, ""CBOE believes that removing the Size Condition will not result in a
large increase in the number of transactions being exempted from Rule 611 because smaller
contingent trades represent a very small portion of the overall amount of stock executions in
listed stocks.""

These trades are now designated as EXEMPT from [Securities Exchange Act Rule 611](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/notice_doc_file_ref/Regulatory-Notice-18-29.pdf)

That seems pretty funny, doesn't it?

It appears that now, off-exchange transactions can be simply marked as QCT Exempt through TRF messaging spec, section 22002.  As long as the broker and the market maker agree on a price, they trade through exemption at that price.

I understand that I did not ELI5 this whole thing, but it is really worth looking into the documentation yourself to comprehend exactly what the market makers and brokerages are doing with retail trades.

I would love to hear from others who are more knowledgeable than I am on this matter and if it has any weight to it.

————-

For the first time ever, a National Hockey League team is valued at $2 billion in the annual valuation rankings from Forbes. Here’s what the valuation estimate and recent acquisition activity in the space could mean for the owner of the Rangers, which is publicly traded.

What Happened: The average National Hockey League team saw a 32% rise in its value assigned in the annual Forbes rankings. The average NHL team is worth $865 million in the new rankings.

This marked the biggest one-year average gain to the average NHL valuation by Forbes since a 50% gain in 2012 when a new Canadian market television deal was signed.

Leading the NHL team rankings is the New York Rangers, valued at $2 billion. The valuation of the Rangers was up 21% from the previous year and marked the first time a team was valued at $2 billion.

Credited with the increase in valuation changes were several recent team sales and a rise in league revenue.

The Pittsburgh Penguins recently entered a deal with Fenway Sports Group for a $900 million purchase price, or around 4.5 times expected revenue for the current 2021-'22 season. Prior to the deal, the average multiple was around four times revenue, according to Forbes.

Deals for the Carolina Hurricanes (2018), New York Islanders (2016), and Arizona Coyotes (2014, 2019) were done at multiples of 3.9, 4.2, 3.3 and 3.0, respectively.

League revenue is increasing thanks to media deals. ESPN, owned by Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Turner, owned by AT&amp;T Inc (NYSE:T) signed new deals that started this season paying the NHL an average of $625 million a year. The previous U.S. media deals from ESPN and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) unit NBC paid an average of $300 million annually.

The league reported hockey-related revenue of $2.9 billion in the 2020-'21 season. Revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion in 2021-'22 and increase to $6 billion for the 2025-'26 season.

Madison Square Garden Sports: The Rangers are owned by Madison Square Garden Sports Corp (NYSE:MSGS), a publicly-traded sports holding company. Madison Square Garden Sports owns the Rangers, the New York Knicks (NBA), Westchester Knicks (NBA G League), Hartford Wolf Pack (AHL) and esports assets such as Counter Logic Gaming and Knicks Gaming, which is in the 2K League owned by the NBA and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO).

The latest rankings from Forbes break the Rangers down at $468 million for sport, $893 million for the market, $309 million for the stadium and $330 million for the brand. The team’s iconic Madison Square Garden Arena is owned by Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp (NYSE:MSGE).

The Knicks were valued at $5.8 billion in the latest Forbes rankings, up 16% from the previous year. The valuation is broken down as $2.0 billion for sport, $2.5 billion for market, $403 million for the stadium and $918 million for the brand.

Taking out the value of Madison Square Garden Arena and the Rangers are valued at $1.7 billion. The Knicks would be valued at $5.4 billion without the stadium. There could be some additional overlap between the values of the teams being owned together.

Ultimately, the two iconic New York teams are valued at $7.1 billion without their stadium.

**Wise Review - Honest and Unbiased**

[Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/khaledb177) , formerly known as TransferWise, is one of the most popular and highly rated international currency transfer and exchange platforms in the world. 

Founded in 2011 by Eristo Käärmann and Tavet Hinkrikus, the company has won a lot of awards by providing a solution for individuals and companies seeking to send money abroad at an affordable rate.

But is Wise actually worth it? Is the company good enough in terms of customer service, value for money, and convenience? And most importantly, is it a perfect fit for you?

These are all valid questions to have, especially given the options out there today when it comes to currency movement, exchange, and transfer. And this is why we have provided a detailed review below on all things Wise. 

By the time you're done reading, you should have a complete picture regarding the company, its currency transfer process, and how fitting it is for your needs.

About Wise

[Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/khaledb177) recognized a particularly challenging problem regarding international payments, and it solved it. A while ago, sending money across borders used to be an incredible source of headache.

Later on, of course, this problem became less challenging with the rise of some financial technology companies. Yet, there remained problems that had to be solved. You see, these companies, while making it relatively easier to send and receive money across borders, were still remarkably slow and quite expensive.

Years later, it is safe to say that Wise solved these problems. Now with Wise, customers get to make their international transactions using affordable mid-market exchange rates without additional charges as it used to be.

What's more, Wise also makes the process of doing all of these incredibly easy. 

How does Wise work?

The Wise platform has continually increased in popularity since its early days. Nowadays, the platform serves no less than 12 nations and facilitates transactions worth billions of dollars.

One of the biggest appeals that continues to attract users to the platform is its simplicity. All you have to do to make use of Wise is to open an account in one easy step. 

You can also make use of your Google or Facebook account to this end.

Of course, you will have to wait a few minutes for code verification and approval, but once your account is approved, you can proceed to set up your account for quick and easy transfers. 

Transfers are done by entering the bank details of the party to which you're sending the money, before lastly you’re asked to verify your identity for compliance adherence.

And that's it. 

After those few easy steps you will get to send money anywhere in the world with a few clicks of your keyboard.

It is also worth noting that Wise's easy and straightforward platform is not the only highlight of the company. We examine other areas where the company stands out below. 

Advantages and Disadvantages of Wise

To understand exactly what factors set Wise apart from its competitors, we take a look at a few highlights of the company below. We also take a further look at some aspects that we either did not find very appealing, or that have generally been points of complaints by others at one point or another.

Advantages of Wise

**Transfer Speeds** \- International transactions take time. You are, after all, sending money across borders with different rules, currencies, and exchange rates. Thanks to its cutting edge technology, however, Wise has come a long way in making these transactions incredibly fast and effortless.

**Transparency** \- Many international payment services either charge you a lot of money to get your transfers done quickly, or include subtle, hidden fees that you don't even know you're paying. Wise offers a perfect mix of affordability with transparency. Whatever they say you are paying is what you are really paying.

**Affordability** \- Not only is Wise transparent with its charges, the charges themselves are not high at all by any stretch of the imagination. Compared to major competitors such as banks and PayPal, Wise's rate may sometimes be as low as 0.39%, or even lower.

This is by far one of the best rates out there. PayPal, for example, charges as high as 8%. And even compared to other cheaper options in the market, they are still one of the best in this regard.

**Easy Process** \- And of course, as we have seen in the previous section, the process of setting up an account and sending payments with Wise is incredibly easy. It is also worth mentioning that the process of receiving payments with Wise is just as easy and just as streamlined as the process of making them.

Disadvantages of Wise

Cash Pickup Option - Some users generally like to have cash pickup options in local outlets. And while we're not particularly concerned about this feature, a handful of customer reviews have indicated that they would appreciate it if such a feature could be made available by Wise in the future.

Others - We have found that Wise users also tend to complain about the following aspects of the company's features: limited currency and country support, lack of cash and cheque options for making payments, and the fact that payments over 10,000 generally incur more relatively expensive charges and there may be better options out there, 

Detailed Wise Review

Having examined what Wise is all about, along with the process, advantages and disadvantages, the next logical move is to understand its reputation, reception trend among existing customers, and most importantly, how particularly fitting they are for your needs.

Reputation / Track record / Trust and safety 

[Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/khaledb177) is a heavily regulated platform. It is present in so many countries, and each of them have regulatory practices by which the company must always abide. 

For instance, Wise is regulated in the USA by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, in the UK by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, in Belgium by the National Bank of Belgium, and in Canada by the Financial Customs and Excise Department.

It has also been established through prior actions that Wise actually does take regulations seriously and make it a constant point of action to always abide by the rules set by these regulatory bodies.

Wise also adopts a fund separation policy to keep your funds safe. It does this by separating your money from its operational funds in tier 1 international banks. 

The platform also claims to run a top level data security program used by the best banks in the world.

Value for money

Wise charges two different types of fees. On card payments, users pay a 1.25% fee for debit cards and 3.8% for credit cards. Business fees cost 1.1% and 4.33% for debit and credit cards respectively. Service fees and fixed fees also vary depending on location and currency.

In the end, all things considered, Wise is usually regarded as one of the best platforms in terms of offering genuine value for money. Their fees and charges are incredibly reasonable for the great deal of efficiency and convenience that the platform provides.

Ease of use

Wise offers one of the simplest, most convenient user interfaces among its competitors. Its transfer process is so simple that it is usually one of the aspects customers who use Wise single out for praise.

Transfers are so straightforward that sometimes it is only a question of entering the recipient's bank details and making payments with your own card. International transfers definitely do not get easier than that.

Customer support

Wise's customer support gets an A from us in terms of accessibility, willingness and ability to help. Getting through to them is quite easy through the website. And once they respond they usually provide enough details and explanation to resolve whatever issues you may have.

When it comes to response time, though, they may not necessarily have one of the fastest out there. Usually they take a while to respond so when you're getting in contact with them, particularly through email exchanges, be prepared to wait a while.

Below are the contact details you'll need to get through to the Wise customer support service.

Customer Support Details

Phone Number - +1 888 908 3833

Website -[ https://wise.com/help](https://wise.com/help)

Wise's customer support is available every day of the year. You can also choose to make use of the live chat feature on their website.

Processing time

Processing time on Wise, and indeed a lot of similar platforms, can never be pegged to a single value thanks to the huge amount of factors in play when you make a transfer.

Selected options such as transaction volume, currency, destination country, rates, and so on, can play a huge role in determining how fast or how slow your transaction takes before it is finalized.

On average, though, Wise does in fact have one of the fastest transaction times out there. In fact, instantaneous transfers are quite common on Wise.

Using a credit or debit card is also allowed on Wise, and is generally known to work faster than bank transfers. 

There are also cheaper options such as ACH payment which may not necessarily be done in the quickest time, but will always require very little transfer fees and charges.

Wise Fees/Charges

Transfer fees and charges on Wise, like the processing time, depends on selected options. It is, however, possible to stimulate your transfer beforehand to discover how much fees and charges you're going to be paying.

You can also find out estimated processing time and guaranteed rates duration using this method.

To stimulate your transfer and find out your estimated charges, visit the Wise website and open the ""Get Your Fees and Speed"" widget, and enter your transfer amount and currency.

The system automatically calculates and displays your transfer fee and guaranteed rate. You can then compare this rate with other platforms.

Usually we have found that Wise offers some of the best rates in the market without a doubt. For instance, for a 2,000 pounds transfer, we found Wise's percentage fees to be 0.39%. 

Compared to PayPal, Banks and other transfer companies, this was the best deal by a large margin.

Wise Customer Reviews

[Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/khaledb177) are generally very well reviewed across all platforms. Users praise the ease of using the platform, the speed of transactions, and the affordable rates they get on Wise compared to competitors.

The not-so-flattering reviews focused mainly on the platform disabling accounts, and reports about troubles using card services.

Is Wise Right for You?

Knowing whether or not Wise is right for you requires considering a few conditions. You have to ask yourself how much you're transacting, how fast you want to get the transaction done, how particular you are about getting reasonable rates, and so on.

We take a look at these factors in detail below.

When to use Wise

We advise people to make use of Wise as their go-to option when they need to get their transfers done quickly. This is not just in terms of making the transactions smooth on your end, but also for the recipient. With Wise, both ends of the transactions are finalized in a very impressive time.

Those who are also very particular about charges and fees can consider Wise to be a great option. Their fees are transparent and highly reasonable. In fact, many regard them as the most affordable option in the US.

Wise is also great for people who are concerned about safety and regulations, fast account creation, and ease of use. All of these are areas in which Wise excels way more than most of its competitors.

When not to use Wise

[Wise](https://wise.com/invite/u/khaledb177) may not be the best option for those who wish to make transfers using cash or cheques. On Wise, you can only make international transfers using your card, bank transfer, or wire transfer.

Wise is also not the best option if you happen to be sending money to someone without a bank account. Wise only supports transfers to bank accounts. The only other option here is creating a Wise Borderless Account.

Lastly, Wise is not advisable if your recipient would prefer to pick up the fund as cash, because currently Wise does not offer local cash pickup options.

Final Verdict

When it comes to reasonable rates, incredible fees, and direct, straightforward process, Wise stands out among competitors as being one of the most excellent in this regard.

Add this to the transaction speed and the fact that the platform offers guaranteed rates for a specified duration of time, and you start to understand why Wise is so well reviewed across all platforms.

The company also offers support for payments using debit and credit card, a feature which is usually missing on similar platforms. 

The only reasons we see why it may not be advisable to use Wise are when users prefer cash or cheque deposits and pickups, and when recipients do not have bank accounts.

8463,wallstreetbets,VLNS Top Cannabis Picks,"I come to you apes with a growth play of all growth plays, The Valens Company ($VLNS). A beat down Canadian cannabis company that is truly undervalued to other Canadian LPs that trade on NASDAQ, such as CRON, CGC, ACB, SNDL &amp; TLRY. As of close December 28, 2021. I'm going to go one step further an look at the LQA (latest quarter annualized) multiple, this will give us the currently quarterly run-rate and approximate the NTM (next twelve month's) revenue. All prices I've used are as of December 28, 2021 and all revenues have been converted at CAD/USD 1.27

CRON is trading at US$1.5B. CRON reported Q2/FY21 of US$15.6M --&gt; Latest quarterly earnings report. Trades at 24.3x LQA

CGC is trading at US$3.7B. CGC reported Q2/FY22 of US$105.9M --&gt; Latest quarterly earnings report. Trades at 8.7x LQA

ACB is trading at US$1.2B. ACB reported Q1/FY22 of US$48.5M --&gt; Latest quarterly earnings report. Trades at 6.2x LQA

SNDL is trading at US$1.25B. SNDL reported Q3/FY21 of US$11.6M --&gt; Latest quarterly earnings report. Trades at 26.9x LQA

TLRY is trading at US$3.45B. TLRY reported Q1/FY22 of US$167.9M --&gt; Latest quarterly earnings report. Trades at 5.1x LQA

VLNS reported Q3/FY21 of US$16.9M --&gt; Latest quarterly earnings report. Trades at 2.7x LQA

The peer average (excluding $VLNS) is 14.2x LQA. If we apply 13.1 to $VLNS US$67.6M (US$16.9M x 4) it will give us a share price of US$14.10 representing a WHOOPING 420%...that right, it's a SIGN for us to BUY!!

Did I also mention, that they have 68M shares outstanding, and $SNDL owns 10% of it already with insiders holding another 5%. The float is \~57.8M which is very small given that robust YoY growth

A very low float with an industry that is growing 30-40% per year with the stock price VERY undervalued. I don't know about you apes, but I'm loading up the boat here and buy as much as I can.

Forgot to mention that $VLNS has a lot going for them as well:

* Green Roads in the US, with an annual revenue of US$27M and growing YoY. They are represented in 50 states, with a growing retail presence. Green Roads only represents the first puzzle piece to $VLNS US strategy. I wouldn't be surprised if they announce another US acquisition in 2022 given the recent CAD$40M term loan they signed with a large private institutional investor.
* Citizen Stash in Canada, which operates in the premium flower segment. The premium flower segment is one of the fastest growing flower segments (just look at California). The price in the premium segment tends to be stickier and produce higher margins then companies competing in the lower flower segment which produces negative margins
* $VLNS holds approximately 10% beverage market share in Canada. $VLNS recently announced the commissioning of Pommies Cider which will grow their SKU count and increase beverage market share in the coming years especially as they create beverages using the SoRSE by Valens emulsion technology. They have the exclusive rights to this technology in Europe, Mexico, Australia and Canada. With Germany announcing its intention to legalize and Mexico following, it makes it clear that Valens will be looking into this markets with potentially a huge CPG partner.
* LYF which provides $VLNS with an innovative edibles platform. They are the first ones to come out with Toasted Coconut Bites and Peanut Butter Cups here in Canada
* $VLNS has presence in the growing Australian medical market. They recently announced a partnership with Epsilon Heathcare to utilize their Therapeutic Goods Administration /EU GMP facility in Southport. This will allow them to ship cannabis products into the growing European market. As per the mutually recognized status of Therapeutic Goods Administration GMP, it is recognized in 29 countries with UK, Germany, France, Netherlands etc. This means that $VLNS could ship THC products into Germany which is going to legalize cannabis and represents a large market in the EU

$VLNS recently listed on the NASDAQ with an attempt to increase liquidity, increase institutional holdings, and increase analyst coverage. All of these benefits will trickle down to $VLNS in the coming months. There has been significant divergence between the cannabis sector (with a max drawdown of 60%) vs. other sectors, as a contrarian the cannabis sector is probably the best sector in term of risk-reward as it represents a significant margin of safety with an industry growing at 30-40% per year.

It's clearly obvious that $VLNS is undervalued, and I will be loading up the boats and seeing you apes in sunny Mexico a year from now

Pros:
-Germany legalization
-Expanding american market(alcholic beverage industry and hemp foods)
-merger saving of $80m

Cons:
-america stalling legalization
-increased cost due to expenditures(short term rev hit)
-revenue target misses
-burning cash pile with heavy expectations on american markets increasing rev

Possible post call outcome:
-Earnings is a miss due to short term expenditures and stock continues to drop
-merger savings was enough for earnings to beat expectations and it sees some green days

8663,wallstreetbets,SPAC warrant question," Hello all,

I hope you can answer a question for me. I am new to SPACs and would appreciate some help.

I have shares of CUPH.u, which are SPAC shares plus 1/4 warrant in the new company. Looking at the SEC filing [https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-005190/](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-005190/):

""Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share of our Class A common stock and one-quarter of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus, and only whole warrants are exercisable.""

Later it says:

""Our sponsor, Compute Health Sponsor LLC, has committed to purchase an aggregate of 11,333,333 warrants (or 12,833,333 warrants if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $1.50 per warrant ($17,000,000 in the aggregate, or $19,250,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. We refer to these warrants as the private placement warrants throughout this prospectus. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein.""

So, here is my question:

Lets say that I have 400 CPUH.u shares (the ones WITH the warrants attached). They announce an acquisition and do all the stuff that's necessary and now the new company is ready to go.

1. Do my 400 shares become 100 shares in the new company without any more cash exchanged?
2. Or do I have to pay $1.50 more per new share of the new company acquired (in this case $150 ($1.50 times 100 shares)?
3. Or do I have to pay 11.50 per share of the new company for a total of $1150 (in this case $11.50 times 100 shares)?

I assume it is either 1 or 2 above, but I hope someone can translate the SEC and CPUH's offering better than I can.

Thank you",1641236990

8669,wallstreetbets,SigmaTron: Deeply Undervalued with High Short Interest,"SigmaTron International ($SGMA) is an electronics manufacturing services company that provides circuit board assemblies and completely assembled box build electronic products.  The stock currently is shorted around 33% of its float, which is quite startling to the average investor.  Yet, digging deeper into fundamentals, we can see this is not justified by my standards.  The PE ratio sits at about 3.63, with the industry average being about 22.  This is absolutely incredible for any company, but does not bring about complete justice.  Its price to book ratio sits at about 0.62, which anything under 1 is considered a deep value.  It also seems to have great future growth with a PEG sitting at about 0.62 which considers estimates of future earnings to current ones.  The company currently holds a net margin of  4.13%, with an industry standard of 3.70%.  Tight profit margins in electronics manufacturing with the ongoing pandemic have made it a challenge to navigate, and this company seems to be excelling.  Recent quarterly reports exclaimed that the company is acquiring WAGZ, a pet Technology company as well as recording a positive $5million in operating income which is their new record income for operations.  Utilizing a formula from Benjamin Graham, the author of the Intelligent Investor, I comprised an intrinsic value of $44.47 by using 2.42 current diluted EPS\*(8.5 standard PE ratio+2(8 estimated CAGR for EMS).  Current assets to liabilities ratio comes out at 1.82, which is outstanding.  

Insider selling has been putting significant downward selling pressure on SGMA, with the director recently retiring and selling her stock along with others selling presumably to raise more cash for the upcoming WAGZ acquisition which currently produces $9 million in revenue.  The small float is something to look out for, with almost 33% shorted as of today!  The price has been plummeting, seemingly putting a fire sale on the company.  The only thing that would make me smile more is SigmaTron releasing pro forma statement on future growth with the WAGZ acquisition.  I cannot possibly comprehend the amount of insider selling when a new acquisition is on the rise and a record net income was formed for the company's lifetime.  They seem to be repositioning in my opinion, and it just seems like a great opportunity that cannot be missed.  A short squeeze could be inevitable, but that is besides the point.  Either way, this could be a money printer for those of you looking for a new stock to throw your diamond  hands on.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not giving financial advice, and I own shares of SigmaTron International and will continue to average down when necessary.",1641236503

But I want to know more about what I'm doing.

* KRBN, 2021 close at $50.99/share; FTWR $24.00 - $54.79
* GRN, 2021 close at $31.65/share; FTWR $12.56 - $35.76

* KRBN, $52.22/share, as of 12:23 EST
* GRN: $32.88/share, as of 12:09 EST

Note that GRN took a major hit with COVID, but seems to be recovering.

Note that over the past year, GRN and KRBN seem to track each other with GRN being about $20/share cheaper.

 To my happy surprise, INVESTOPIDIA has recommended these along with BDRY in a recent article:

8715,wallstreetbets,Healthcare/Biotech Sector DD (what to look for and how to value companies),"As we are currently in the midst of the global pandemic, where there have been almost 250 million cases and over 5 million deaths, the world is now acutely aware of the dangers of disease. This paranoia has directed a lot of attention towards the Healthcare sector in business, which has consistently been one of the fastest growing sectors in the past few decades. Another huge metric that will boost growth in the healthcare sector is the rise in an aging population around the world as a result of the aging “baby boomer generation”, which is an extremely large demographic containing more than 71 million people. This aging demographic will lead to more sales and investments in the healthcare sector as companies work to provide treatment for treating disabilities and illnesses that develop with age such as Alzhemiers and Arthritis. 

There are many reasons for this such as the rise of technological advances in medicine, obesity epidemics, and global reach of disease. Some of the noteworthy aspects of the healthcare sector which is seen by investors to have high potential growth are in Biotechnology and Vaccination. The Coronavirus epidemic made a point to highlight the importance of vaccinations in helping to prevent the spread and lighten the severity of global pandemics. As a result of the Coronavirus potentially being a yearly recurrence, this is a potentially a huge market for many Vaccine related companies. Some of the leading companies in developing vaccinations such as Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson have seen massive growth from developing and sales of vaccines. 

Additionally, another reason that the Healthcare sector is attractive to investors is because of the rise in advancement of biotechnology. New techniques for gene editing such as CRISPR-Cas9 has already been introduced into some medical procedures and have shown solid performance. Despite having a few setbacks, it is a very solid belief that once these are overcome, it will become a revolutionary new tool for treatmenting and potentially curing genetic disease. Additionary, many other potentially world changing biotechnology products have been provided massive funding and are undergoing extensive development such as Single cell technologies, Aptamer diseases, stem cell therapies, and DNA hard drives. If even a single one of these products are successfully developed to aid in large scale medical procedures, the company will encounter explosive growth. 

Unfortunately, another factor that is also contributing to increased growth in the Healthcare sector is the overall worsening of the environment. The decrease in air quality in many of the major cities around the world as well as major pollution seen in water and earth contributes to a decrease in overall health around the world. This is a major problem that is affecting the whole world, and can be seen in studies which show that air pollution is a factor that leads to almost 7 million deaths per year, these are due to health effects which contribute to diseases such as strokes, lung cancer, and heart disease of which ⅓ of the deaths are attributed to air pollution.

**Biotechnology:** Biotechnology company valuation metrics are different from the typically “standard” for valuing companies. Metrics such as Cash Flow and EBITDA do not tell the full story as many biotech companies do not make much money until they get FDA approval for a drug. 

My approach for valuing biotech companies is by relying on the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), which by adding the present value of each drug handled by the company to the net present value will give a fair value for  what the whole company is worth.

**Pharmaceuticals:** For pharmaceutical companies standard valuation metrics such as Cash Flow Statements and EBITDA are heavily considered. Additionally we should put a heavy emphasis on the companies R&amp;D spending as well and development cost per product. 

**Danger Signs:**

We should also be aware of a few risk factors when looking into companies in the healthcare sector. Customer trust is extremely important for this sector as the effects of these products directly affect the lives of its customers. 

As such we must keep in mind the customer complaints regarding the company's products as well as any controversies the company has been involved in in the past.

8718,wallstreetbets,TLRY time to own and hold for 68,"For the first quarter of 2022, Tilray reported revenue of $168 million. On a year-on-year basis, revenue growth was 43%. It’s also likely that revenue growth will continue to accelerate in the next few years.

Back in August 2021, the company’s chairman and CEO shared a $4.0 billion revenue plan by 2024. If the company is to meet this guidance, growth needs to accelerate.

 

Tilray believes that the global cannabis market opportunity is worth $186 billion. With more countries legalizing cannabis for medicinal and recreational, there is significant untapped opportunity. Tilray, being the largest player globally, is well-positioned to capitalize.

Tilray is focused on medicinal cannabis, which can be a long-term game-changer. The company already has a distribution network in Germany with a leadership position.

Additionally, Tilray has an end-to-end European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (EU-GMP) supply chain. The company estimates that the European medicinal cannabis market will be worth $3.9 billion by 2025. As the market gets bigger, Tilray is likely to witness growth acceleration.

TOP 11 STOCKS FOR 2022


Another factor that’s likely to support growth is acquisitions.

In August 2021, Tilray acquired MedMen, which is a leading U.S. cannabis retail brand. Tilray has already acquired Manitoba Harvest, a maker of branded hemp-based food products in the United States.

The acquisition of SweetWater will help the company expand into cannabis-infused beverages in the U.S. The key point here is the sustained belief that Federal level legalization of cannabis is around the corner. Tilray is already expanding its presence in the U.S. This is a key growth acceleration catalyst.

Ongoing Cash Burn

Tilray reported its tenth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2022. However, the markets are likely to remain unimpressed with positive “adjusted” EBITDA.

The key point to note here is that Tilray reported negative adjusted free cash flow of $61.2 million for the quarter. FCF is likely to remain negative in the coming quarters.

The reason is high spending on research and development. Additionally, as Tilray expands into new markets, selling and marketing expenses will remain high. This is not necessarily a concern if top-line growth accelerates.

However, it’s worth noting that Tilray reported cash and equivalents of $376 million as of Q1 2022. Considering the rate of cash burn, equity dilution might be on the cards.

Having said that, TLRY stock might have already discounted any dilution or leveraging factor. Fundraising to accelerate growth is likely to take the stock higher.

Concluding Views

Cash burn has been a challenge for all companies in the cannabis industry. However, as the market size expands, operating leverage is likely to ensure that key margins improve.

Tilray has a healthy presence in the medicinal and recreational cannabis segment. The company has leadership position in key markets like Canada (recreational cannabis) and Germany (medicinal cannabis).

With the possible Federal level legalization of cannabis in the United States, the company has ample headroom to accelerate growth.

Stock may be flat until merger, but it would be wise to start building a position now as the capitulation may have reached a floor (see 7-10% gain in first day of trading for 2022).

**Disclosure;** I am long DISCA and DISCK.

**Target;** DISC trades at a significant discount in forward EV/EBITDA (x8.45) compared to competitors NFLX (x32.7) and DISNEY (x22). ARPU stands to grow from $7 - $11 at merger, an increase of 57%. Conservatively, were EV/EBITDA to grow linearly in accordance to x13.27, it would still trade at a discount to its peers and a share price of \~$36 (56% upside)

**Tip;** Prefer DISCK over DISCA (voting) shares as DISCK still trades at a discount and all shares will be rolled into the same class of newco.

The DISC merger, expected in Q2 2022 - where T spins off its Warner Media division (including HBO) to form NewCo is one of the biggest upcoming deals this year.

Looking at the IP portfolio for newco is staggering - 200000 hours of content spanning WB, HBO, TLC, DISC, HGTV, TNT, CNN, Olympics and more. It spans a massive content sector (specific to un/scripted reality-tv, sports, major film releases for the remaining cable-cutting audience that consumes this particular content) for the streaming industry that is lacking in the current streaming ecosystem (eg, most of this material was pulled from Hulu). DISC carries massive international potential through its reach across 220+ countries and 50 languages (eg, [DISC holds exclusive rights for Olympics broadcasting in Europe until 2024 - with the next Olympics around the corner - valued at 1.4B](https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-awards-all-tv-and-multiplatform-broadcast-rights-in-europe-to-discovery-and-eurosport-for-2018-2024-olympic-games)). There's no question the content library is there, but what about the numbers.

With an TTM PE of 17 (vs. NFLX 53, DISNEY 142) and only 20M subscribers vs. NFLX 240M and DISNEY 118M - and an estimated newco growth to \~100M via the merger this year (76M via HBO Max, 22M from DISC) the potential for growth is quite apparent. The combined Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) stands to be $11/user, or 1.10B/month or 13.2B/year with a free cash flow of 7.83B/year. With DISC ARPU currently at approximately $7, this is a 57% gain in ARPU immediately at merger. With an extremely conservative estimate of a mere 5% user growth per year, we reach approximately 130M subscribers by 2026. Management forecasts cost-savings through the merger (reducing marketing spend of independent entities into one), but say ARPU remains consistent in the worst case scenario, that increases revenue to 1.43B for 2026 of 17.16B/year. The two companies currently produce an average FCF at around 59%, which again, in the worst case scenario (remaining flat) brings us to a conservative estimate for FCF of 10.3B/year. Future CEO, David Zaslav [points to a long term goal of 400M subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/david-zaslav-on-subscriber-goals-for-combined-discovery-warnermedia.html) which would bring this estimate even higher.

Management has expressed expectations to reduce gross debt down from 5.0x gross debt/EBITDA within a few years. Given the conservative FCF growth estimate of 33%, this seems reasonable.

T holders receive 71% in newco, DISC holders receive remaining 29%. This presents a potential 112.45B EV and 60B of debt for a total market cap of 52.45B for newco, and an estimated 2.4m shares outstanding at the current price \~ $22.90.

\--

Finally, for those of you that like a short squeeze, DISCA currently holds a FF% of 13.5% and Days to Cover of 10.14 (compare to AMC 20%, 2.35, GME 16.46% 4.37, SNDL 18.6% 3.38) according to the latest data from Ortex.",1641232002

REK -

This ETF offers -1x daily leverage to an index comprised of U.S. REITs, giving sophisticated investors a tool for expressing a bearish short-term view of the U.S. real estate sector. It should be noted that the daily reset feature makes REK inappropriate for investors without the ability or willingness to monitor this position on a regular (daily) basis.

The product is exploding in growth and it’s public facing product meaning investors can support the firm like GME OR AMC. But the stock and buy the product this is the way. 


VIAC has been struggling since bill Hwang but before that is was a failing media empire with great IP and relationships. The channels have been rejuvenated and synergies are flowing stronger than ever. 

Enter Pluto TV and Paramount plus AKA CBS AA rebrand. These products are both new and desirable. Pluto is like linear TV but digital and has on demand functionality. All supported by advertising via traditional commercials. This business is already breaking $1 billion dollars in annual revenue. Paramount is cracking $5 billion in annual run rate as of a few weeks ago and a few million new subs. Yellow stone is the franchise driving new subs. They have 2 new shows including a Yellowstone prequel Y1883 and mayor of Kingstown which is the same universe. These shows have already gotten millions of views on paramount plus adding subs and building stronger franchise IP. 

I traded the last investor day and I’m trading this one in q1 22 the date is not announced yet but the last one was in February and I traded the mid March calls before the end of the climb. Bill Hwang fucked up he could not keep his leverage, the stock high and support the issue of new shares without the house of cards collapsing but today the stock is similar to a year ago and the business is significantly improved. 

That’s a fact that can’t be disputed. The stock is cheap and the company can deliver significant gains to investors.",1641228270

Any ideas about the metals used in microchips for the cars?

Most microchips  need palladium and platinum and sometimes low grade gold.

Palladium had collapsed in 2021 due to supply chain shortages especially microchips and cars 

Im not done here, palladium and platinum are essential in exhausts for car that use petrol, and gas.

You may think that electric cars are the trend but face it, electric cars are 10% only.

Alot of people speculating a fight between bears and bulls on those 2 precious metals. There is huge shortages on supply chains that will rejuvenate in 2022 and im not talking electric.

What a ride 2021 has been for **Cassava Sciences (**[**SAVA**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sava/forecast)**)** stock. The extent of the wild share price fluctuations can be gauged by the fact that despite shares pulling back 66% from July’s highs, the stock has still delivered a year-to-date gain of 520%.

The highs – and the lows – have all been due to simufilam, the company’s candidate for the notoriously difficult-to-treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In clinical studies, simufilam has managed to do what other mooted AD treatment have never done before. Following 6 months, 9 months, and then a 12-month analysis, patients’ cognitive behavior still improved.

But those feats have been called into question, after a citizen petition filed with the FDA claimed that Cassava’s data collecting and analysis methods were deceiving and the results weren’t what they seemed. There have also been allegations that peer-reviewed articles were based on manipulated data. One published in July 2012 and the other from 2005.

Following the former being cleared of any data manipulation, now according to a Neuroscience journal article, there’s no evidence which shows data was manipulated in a scientific article published in 2005 and authored by Cassava and its scientific associates.

Jones analyst [Soumit Roy](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/soumit-roy) says his focus is “entirely on the clinical data,” of which he has so far seen “clear chain of custody.”

“Cassava’s drug has shown a steady and directionally positive clinical improvement,” the 5-star analyst went on to say. “With larger cohort size in Phase 3 trials, we expect the standard deviations to tighten up and look similar to Lilly’s standard deviation spread (Eli Lilly’s AD candidate donanemab). Any cognition improvement above the baseline would be best-in-class, and we have seen clear trend towards that with Cassava’s simufilam.”

Roy sees two “key” catalysts ahead. One from the 12-month data details from the ongoing open-label study in Alzheimer’s disease – anticipated in 1Q22, while the cognition maintenance Phase 2 randomized controlled trial with simufilam should get a data readout in 1H/mid-2022.

It should come as no surprise, then, that Roy stays with the bulls. The top analyst thinks SAVA shares have a way to go still. In fact, Roy’s Buy rating is backed by a $215 price target, suggesting returns of a huge 409% over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Roy’s track record, [**click here**](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/soumit-roy))

According to the Street’s $159.25 average target, the gains will be a more “modest” 265%. All 4 recent SAVA reviews are positive, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. ([See SAVA stock analysis on TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sava/stock-analysis))",1641217183

8907,wallstreetbets,After-hours are the Wild West of stock trading," 

Trading big moves in the after-hours are the Wild West of stock trading. When [volume](https://www.thebalance.com/day-trading-based-on-buying-volume-and-selling-volume-1031209) is low(er) and fewer traders are participating in buying stocks, moves can be extreme and rapid. It means big profit potential but also a big risk, and in some situations, it may be very difficult to even determine what that risk is. There is one major advantage to trading after hours, and that is:

* Less competition. With fewer active traders, an individual can nab favorable prices that may not be available once more liquidity enters the market again.

Unfortunately, this advantage also has a downside. Less competition means:

* Less volume
* More erratic price moves

So this being said,

Overstock.com was founded in 1997 and is primarily an online retailer for home goods, but they also own a subsidiary called Medici Ventures, a venture capital fund that manages and oversees 19 block ⛓ technology companies. 

Current Stock Price and Market Cap:

$58 and $2.5 Billion

Bull Cases:

- Trading at less than 0.9x price to sales compared to the industry average of 4.5x

- $512 million in cash (20% of market cap)

- Announced $100 million stock repurchase program

- Positive free cash flow

- 6 straight profitable quarters

- 23% gross margins 

- Ranked 4th in online revenue out of online home furnishing brands, (a $325 billion market.) Only behind Amazon, Wayfair, and Walmart

- Have been able to avoid supply chain issues while also increasing their margins with their distributed supply chain network and drop shipping business model. 

- Taking market share from Wayfair despite Wayfair trading at a 40% P/S premium over OSTK. Not to mention Wayfair isn’t even profitable 

- Projected 12% growth in 2022 despite the pandemic fueled hyper growth they experienced throughout 2020-2021.

- The value of their ownership of Medici Ventures is not baked it to the stock price. tZero and Bitt (the two largest holdings) are worth at least $1 billion by themselves, not to mention the other 17 companies they hold.

- tZero is reportedly looking to get bought out or could possibly go public via SPAC. Either of these would send Overstock to the 🌕

- Average analyst price target is $120 with a street high of $157 and low of $90. (Current price is $59)

Bear Cases:

- Q3 revenue growth slightly decelerated by -4% since Q3 of 2020 

- Competitors with behemoths such as Amazon and Walmart

- Stock has been getting crushed recently for no fundamental reason, going from $108 on 11/19 to $59 on 12/31. Though I believe this is likely the bottom as the stock has gone from $60 to $100+ 3 times in the last year

- Shorts love this stock. 12% of free float sold short

Summary:

I know Overstock isn’t the most exciting company out there but the the value and risk/reward here is undeniable. Their online retail business alone is definitely undervalued and their ownership of Medici Ventures basically serves as a free call option within the stock. They also have juicy premiums which is nice for hodlers who like to sell covered calls",1641210999

The future direction of Vaccine stocks is very difficult to predict based on fundamentals alone as these depend on future vaccine sales which are very unpredictable at the moment. Technical analysis, however, might offer some insights. 

After trading for more than 20 years I have found that it is not a good idea to sell or short a stock after a significant decline, especially near a support level.  

NVAX hit an important support level at 141 on Friday.

It has bounced from this support 3 times during the last year and I believe that it will bounce again this time  given the divergences with the Money Flow Index (MFI), sideways price action (more evident in the weekly chart) and the direction of the 200 day moving average. 

Currently, looking at the price action during the last 3 months, investors think that a fair value for NVAX is between 220-141. The most probable outcome is that the price will oscillate between support and resistance until future earnings become more predictable.",1641208260

8972,wallstreetbets,Dear foreign shareholders of Korea Financial Group (071050),"First, I hope God bless you.
I'm an individual investor in Korea.

Korea's stock market is overly distorted. In particular, there are many entrepreneurs who thoroughly ignore shareholder interests, which are the duty of stock company, and do not fulfill the duty of care of good managers at all. It's really the worst.

So I'd like to give you a suggestion. I want to help maximize your profits at the shareholders' meeting in March this year. If you delegate your stock voting rights to me, I will be able to strengthen the agenda I propose at the general shareholders' meeting.

The agenda I will propose is as follows.
1. Since the current dividend guideline of 20% is too low, the dividend guideline should be raised to 40% of the consolidated net profit.
2. After selling all 27% of Kakao Bank's shares (expected to be around 6 trillion to 7 trillion won), 20% of the amount will be used for treasury stock purchases and 30% for free capital increase. (Free capital increase contributes to corporate capital increase, allowing more customers to borrow money.)
3. It shall be incinerated as soon as the treasury stock purchase is completed.
4. In the future, managers should actively prepare a company operation policy to maximize shareholder profits.

Even if this happens, investors' equity value will rise dramatically. I need your strength. Currently, the goal is to be delegated 20.7% of the CEO's stake (11,534,636 shares) and 10.97% (6,111,632 shares, as of September 30, 21) of the National Pension Service.

If shareholders in foreign countries delegate their voting rights, individual investors in Korea will also be able to collect voting rights.

Please read it and if you think my proposal is reasonable and want to be with me, please contact me at the address below.

E-mail : ainvestorinkorea@gmail.com

It's a little late, but happy new year.
Thank you.

P.S. If you are reading this letter and you are investing in another company in Korea and want to maximize profits in that company, you can tell me. We will be delegated voting rights mainly by companies that can secure as many voting rights as possible.

Oh, and is there a way to let your people know about this? For example, through a securities firm. If you know how, please answer. Thank you.",1641200071

\&gt; i am setting it as a 2 year interval since the first GPU will be released in 2022 Q1 (BTW the product line will be named ""Xe"", aiming for desktop setups, which is what is usually used for mining because is more cost efficient), i think it will go under the radar since there will certainly be problems related to adoption and overall inferior performance to competitors, the second interaction however will be where my money is pointing to since the leaks are showing a very bonkers product, with a correct pricing it will shake the reign of Nvidia for discrete GPUs.

\&gt; there are two biggest thing that makes this somewhat risky, 

1. working from home culture and blockchain ecosystem needs to at the very least keep current momentum, this will hold the shortage long enough for intel to get the fabs up and running
2. intel needs to not pussy out from the GPU line-up, they are very quick to pull the trigger on underperforming products, while the 2022 and 2023 GPUS are confirmed and being work on, if they dont meet the expectations, it might get canned for 2024.

8990,wallstreetbets,Do apes agree? My response to runpopularopinion (I’m not an ape),"Quick context: OP was saying that Reddit sucks for not paying content creators and that requiring real money to give awards was bad. TL/DR I thought you all were probably the answer (at the end). Is it ok I said this?

Breaking news: social media is overrated and simply a scam to grow profits for the overlords of our users.

This is me agreeing OP. There are amazing communities with fantastic users who produce incredible content. And there are memes and shitposts. I love them all. The community makes Reddit.

But (here is the “but) we cannot forget that Reddit is a business and their goal is to make money. So of course they will make money on things like awards and ads.

If they paid content creators for awards, then they’d probably have to dump more ads on us.

But I think we both know that when Reddit goes public this year, those ads are getting dumped on us anyway. A new board will come in. And this place will change a lot.

r/wallstreetbets is our only hope. We must all support them, hope they buy 51% of Reddit stock so they become the majority vote and shareholders.

Users will be awarded in gift cards instead of the current awards (probably Wendy’s gift cards though, if I had to guess). Elon musk would probably be elected chairman of the board against his own consent or interest. And I’d even bet that all parking spaces at Reddit headquarters will be reserved for Lambos, boats, or spaceships.

And the best part is all ads will be re-routed to only bear-themed subs, while all others will be ad-free.

Turing Test Proctor 1 point 1 day ago 

I am a bot from /r/wallstreetbets. Your submission was removed because was too short. Please make it a comment if it's not worth expounding on.

And thank you bot you are right I should type more words into this box because being concise is not an option well thank you bot for this opportunity to be as verbose as possible. I never wondered before twhat is the character limit for a post.  Ah ! It is 40'000, well can't say I want to write that much but getting it over say 2000 that should do the trick right ? So this is a pretty simple question, I work in aviation, we need batteries, we need batteries with the most energy per kilogram and we don' t care about the cost. That means heavy ass rechargeables are OUT. I want 400% more battery per battery and that recharging stuff is not worth it. So after doing a fuck ton of research, looks like the best battery, that is made out of regular materials and has high capacity is the aluminium-air battery. It's still way more heavy than regular fuel but it's a solid 4 times better than lithium ion and unlike lithium ion, it' s not an already maxed out technology. So, non rechargeable might make youu think it's like those shitty duracell batteries that have cause a monstrous amount of waste per kWh. But it' s nothing like that and here why I think this battery is the FUCKING future.  The battery is a box that you just insert, basically heatsink-shaped chunks on aluminium. Like a 30Kg  chunk of aluminium. You just dump it in your battery, there, instantly recharged battery. No supercharger network by Elon Musk, shut that shit down not needed anymore ! Instead we just ship out eletrolysed aluminium extrusions in the shape of a rough heatsink.   Everywhere that has got sun and excess solar energy ? They electrolyse aluminium with it. The battery is a box and it turns those chunks of aluminium (called battery anode) into aluminium oxide powder. That is the last raw material in the aluminium production chain before making pure aluminium. So you see, non rechargeable battery is not really the correct thing to call them but we don' t have anything like this. It's like a coal power plant, except it's tiny, only emits water vapour and the coal is pure aluminium and the only waste product is aluminum oxide. Which will be 100% turned back into more aluminium anodes. And there's really no other battery technology for "" cars and bigger"" that's not completely shit  compared to that. We are going to have people all over the place running solar powered micro-aluminium smelters, how fucking cool is that ? So, making these first aluminium batteries, they realized that aluminium production uses graphite anodes for electrolysis, and since the process happens at 600C the cheap material to use is graphite.  But graphite at 600C in aluminium, it turns into CO2. But who cares about CO2 in aluminium production. They emit 2 tons of CO2 (free for them) but they get 1 ton of pure aluminium. So they never bothered finding a cathode that doesn't turn into pollution. So aluminium air battery companies asked the aluminium smelter company to make an aluminium smelting process that doesn't release CO2 right there in the reaction. Turns out all they had to do was take any conductive metal that doesn't melt at 660C  and coat it with corrosion resistant alloy. Now they don't tell what metals they chose, but it's probably something any chemistry baby can put together in 5 minutes. I' m going to go with some nickel copper alloy with a platinum aluminid coating, works good for turbine blades, should do just as good as not corroding at half the temperature. ok that better be enough characters not to get auto deleted by the stupid fucking bot, oh I hope they don't auto delete posts with fuck in it, oh fuck",1641189668

Here. [Check a look at the amazing TA with GME sitting comfortably on the 2021 YTD VWAP](https://i.imgur.com/xl6BvYo.jpg).  

*Look at all those triangles. Mooooooon tomorrow!!!*  

You don't make financial decisions based on shapes do you? Well instead of displaying to you how two lines on a chart form a triangle, this DD will draw you lines but wrapped with theoretical bullshit containing Wyckoff Method, IV percentile, and Nancy Pelosi. 

## First, go educate yourself about the [Wyckoff Method](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).

Yeah, I wouldn't read that long ass article either.  
In short, the market can be understood and anticipated through analysis of supply and demand. Price cycles through accumulation, markup, distribution, and then markdown. Accumulation and distribution events can be illustrated in certain patterns. 

[Picture](https://i.imgur.com/XX369Uf.png)

This method was developed by Richard Wyckoff a century ago, who realized that stock price trends were driven primarily by institutional and other large operators who manipulate stock prices in their favor. Using Wyckoff's method, one can invest in stocks by capitalizing on the intentions of the large “smart money” interests, rather than being caught on the wrong side of the market.

Two patterns to know that your brain will filter regardless: [wrinkle1](https://i.imgur.com/HnRoUVN.png) , [wrinkle2](https://i.imgur.com/MCx85wM.png)

*""This Wackoff Method sounds some fringe TA/astrology mumbo jumbo.""*  
It sure is. Yet 100 years later, these tried and true accumulation/distribution patterns can still be observed today. 

1. [This guy predicted the May selloff with Wyckoff](https://i.imgur.com/WnlEuk4.jpg)

2. [Scored one of my best wins last year in the fall thanks to Wyckoff](https://i.imgur.com/1ztCaoj.png)

- [Now with our favorite stock](https://i.imgur.com/AmhdX8O.png)

I believe GME has just completed a spring/shakeout and the trend will gradually become bullish. Spring is a definitive test of available supply before a markup campaign unfolds. It may occur once a price advance has started, with rapid downward movement intended to induce retail traders and investors in long positions to sell their shares to large operators at bargain prices.   
But then again, I am a expert at wacking off, not Wyckoff.

*""Retail owns the float shill. Why would the hedgies want GME to rocket. It is us against the corrupt and fraudalent financial markets from the SEC to the DTCC.""*  
I agree fuck the gay bears and naked short selling. However, if you believe this is some David vs Goliath story like the media said in January, keep drinking that Koolaid. 

*""Institutions don't move/manipulate stock prices. You're spewing conspiracy crap.""*    
You must be from the same herd of sheep who believed WSB was the one to squeeze silver last February.   
 
*""GME moves in cycles bro, not some Wackoff baloney.""*  
Is GME a tampon? You shove GME in your portfolio one week, and then leave it out the next three?   
To be fair, I am not familiar with market mechanics such as FTD cycles. If the cycles have merit, then I would hope the next bullish momentum in phase D of Wyckoff aligns with the next cycle. 

##Low IV percentile typically provides a optimal environment for institutional sharks to feed.  

Most of the time, institutions aren't retarded like us. Most of the time. We ape into otm FDs on earnings day just to watch them get stomped on by IV the next day. Institutions buy options when the IV percentile is at or near the lowest, because that is when they are at a discount. 

Coincidentally when a stock's IV percentile is at its lowest, retail is the most bearish. A stock at a low IV percentile normally is consolidating and will starfish. Not talking about the sea creature. So the stock price lays flat, unmoving, and retail tends to get bored. They then pull out of their long positions to pump some hot flavor of the month stock with high IV. Meanwhile, institutions continue to add to their position. Hence inverse retail is a known strategy.

Theta gang finds this amusing though. So if any theta gang comes across this, fuck you you milquetoast asshats.  

Majority retail has become bearish on GME, which has starfished around the $180-$200 area for most of the year with a few spasms of volatility. Of course there remains a few enthusiasts, but let's just lock those animals up in a cage where they belong. If you talk to folk aside from them, most would say the stock is dead. In the past year, retail has been turned off to GME due to a combination of media bombardment of ""forget GME"" stories, getting burned by GME's volatility and new-age meme(scam) stocks like CLOV, and the fanaticism of QME members. 

It just so happens GME and other meme stocks are at or near their lowest IV percentile of the past year. Everything in the market moves in cycles. Periods of low volatility will become periods of high volatility. Here are a few examples last year:

1. [Tesla in the summer before the run to the $1000](https://i.imgur.com/jLIrA3L.png)

2. [AMC in the summer before the run to $70](https://i.imgur.com/zIIjuPd.png)

3. [MU in the fall](https://i.imgur.com/niAiF8S.png) 

- [GME now](https://i.imgur.com/ewPa5P0.png)

I do not believe the current lull in GME IV and other meme stocks will last forever. As you can see in the GME chart, whenever GME reaches a trough of low IV rank, it does not take long for the IV to increase and the price to spike. 

Now low IV percentile does not guarantee a stock will explode to the upside. What the previous 3 examples had along with low IV was high open interest in the options chain. Institutions were accumulating options on those stocks during that time period. Currently, OG meme stock (GME, AMC, NOK, BB) option chains are brimming with open interest. Wyckoff and Pelosi lets me believe the volatility will be to the upside.  

*""Buy AMC, it will beat GME!!""*  
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. You must really be taking a fat shit on the toilet. I'm still not done talking though, so don't wipe yet. 

##Last week, we all saw what the greatest trader in America's free market has purchased. 
From her holdings, Nancy Pelosi is bullish on 3 sectors:  
- tech/cloud =&gt; MU, GOOGL, CRM  
- metaverse =&gt; RBLX  
- reopening =&gt; DIS, REOF XX LLC (owns Marriott hotels)

If Pelosi is bullish on these 3 sectors, then there is no way they wouldn't be tendie machines in 2022 right? It just so happens GME fits as a metaverse and reopening play. It isn't a metaverse play yet though. GME plans for the metaverse are unknown outside of speculation, [but they do have something in motion](https://www.yahoo.com/now/gamestop-eyes-metaverse-hunt-ethereum-174139128.html). This could be a strong catalyst. &gt;!Hey look the 💍 chart is bull flagging while GME is consolidating. Could it be tha- oh fuck I'm out of tinfoil to wrap around my head.!&lt; 

Clearly, Nancy Pelosi thinks Omnicron is bullish. I am no doctor/scientist, but if she is willing to bet on Disney and Marriott hotels doing well this year then the heavily shorted retail stores may see upside as well. Good thing GME is a part of those too (XRT). A rising tide raises all ships.  

*""But but no business plan, they are burning cash, the fundament-""*

Fundamentals will catch up eventually, but in the meantime this market moves on supply and demand. So fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink or yank rates back to the Volcker days. 

GME may not have the same reported short interest and retail interest as it did last year, but it has lower liquidity thanks to a cult locking up shares and better fundamental catalysts.

Now with gradually decreasing supply, if the overall retail interest were to return and bring back demand, GME could... Nevermind, you didn't hear it from me.

9078,wallstreetbets,QE is not money printing,"Obviously the narrative of 2020 and 2021 has been don't fight the fed because the fed has control of the printing press and will keep printing until the dollar goes to zero. Also that all that printed money has to find a home which basically flows into the stock market. I initially believed this narrative until I saw what bond yields were trading at and realized countries like Japan and much of Europe were doing QE for decades without hyperinflation. Here's a quick example of how QE works: bank buys 10 trillion of bonds from the treasury. They now have 10 trillion of bonds as assets on their books. The fed then buys those from the bank and the bank now has 10 trillion of reserves on it's balance sheet instead. Nothing really has changed since this is basically an asset swap and the bank could have sold those treauries on the open market if it needed cash as they tend to be quite liquid. Meanwhile the fed's balance sheet has increased by 10 trillion. 

Fast forward to late 2021 and the big banks are parking close to 2 trillion dollars at the federal reserve on a daily basis to earn interest on excess reserve. Basically what happened is the fed gave banks reserves and the banks in turn just parked those reserves at the fed instead of making new loans. This goes against the mainstream narrative that money from QE has to flow into stocks. My conclusion is that the stock market effect from QE would appear almost completely psychological unless someone has a different opinion and could educate me.",1641177407

*Look at all those triangles. Mooooooon tomorrow!!!*  

You don't make financial decisions based on shapes do you? Well instead of displaying to you how two lines on a chart form a triangle, this DD will draw you lines but wrapped with theoretical bullshit containing Wyckoff Method, IV percentile, and Nancy Pelosi. 

## First, go educate yourself about the [Wyckoff Method](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).

Yeah, I wouldn't read that long ass article either.  
In short, the market can be understood and anticipated through analysis of supply and demand. Price cycles through accumulation, markup, distribution, and then markdown. Accumulation and distribution events can be illustrated in certain patterns. 

[Picture](https://i.imgur.com/XX369Uf.png)

This method was developed by Richard Wyckoff a century ago, who realized that stock price trends were driven primarily by institutional and other large operators who manipulate stock prices in their favor. Using Wyckoff's method, one can invest in stocks by capitalizing on the intentions of the large “smart money” interests, rather than being caught on the wrong side of the market.

Two patterns to know that your brain will filter regardless: [wrinkle1](https://i.imgur.com/HnRoUVN.png) , [wrinkle2](https://i.imgur.com/MCx85wM.png)

*""This Wackoff Method sounds some fringe TA/astrology mumbo jumbo.""*  
It sure is. Yet 100 years later, these tried and true accumulation/distribution patterns can still be observed today.

I believe GME has just completed a spring/shakeout and the trend will gradually become bullish. Spring is a definitive test of available supply before a markup campaign unfolds. It may occur once a price advance has started, with rapid downward movement intended to induce retail traders and investors in long positions to sell their shares to large operators at bargain prices.   
But then again, I am a expert at wacking off, not Wyckoff.

*""Retail owns the float shill. Why would the hedgies want GME to rocket. It is us against the corrupt and fraudalent financial markets from the SEC to the DTCC.""*  
I agree fuck the gay bears and naked short selling. However, if you believe this is some David vs Goliath story like the media said in January, keep drinking that Koolaid. 

*""Institutions don't move/manipulate stock prices. You're spewing conspiracy crap.""*    
You must be from the same herd of sheep who believed WSB was the one to squeeze silver last February.   
 
*""GME moves in cycles bro, not some Wackoff baloney.""*  
Is GME a tampon? You shove GME in your portfolio one week, and then leave it out the next three?   
To be fair, I am not familiar with market mechanics such as FTD cycles. If the cycles have merit, then I would hope the next bullish momentum in phase D of Wyckoff aligns with the next cycle. 

##Low IV percentile typically provides a optimal environment for institutional sharks to feed.  

Most of the time, institutions aren't retarded like us. Most of the time. We ape into otm FDs on earnings day just to watch them get stomped on by IV the next day. Institutions buy options when the IV percentile is at or near the lowest, because that is when they are at a discount. 

Coincidentally when a stock's IV percentile is at its lowest, retail is the most bearish. A stock at a low IV percentile normally is consolidating and will starfish. Not talking about the sea creature. So the stock price lays flat, unmoving, and retail tends to get bored. They then pull out of their long positions to pump some hot flavor of the month stock with high IV. Meanwhile, institutions continue to add to their position. Hence inverse retail is a known strategy.

Theta gang finds this amusing though. So if any theta gang comes across this, fuck you you milquetoast asshats.  

Majority retail has become bearish on GME, which has starfished around the $180-$200 area for most of the year with a few spasms of volatility. Of course there remains a few enthusiasts, but let's just lock those animals up in a cage where they belong. If you talk to folk aside from them, most would say the stock is dead. In the past year, retail has been turned off to GME due to a combination of media bombardment of ""forget GME"" stories, getting burned by GME's volatility and new-age meme(scam) stocks like CLOV, and the fanaticism of QME members. 

It just so happens GME and other meme stocks are at or near their lowest IV percentile of the past year. Everything in the market moves in cycles. Periods of low volatility will become periods of high volatility. Here are a few examples last year:

1. [Tesla in the summer before the run to the $1000](https://i.imgur.com/jLIrA3L.png)

2. [AMC in the summer before the run to $70](https://i.imgur.com/zIIjuPd.png)

3. [MU in the fall](https://i.imgur.com/niAiF8S.png) 

- [GME now](https://i.imgur.com/ewPa5P0.png)

I do not believe the current lull in GME IV and other meme stocks will last forever. As you can see in the GME chart, whenever GME reaches a trough of low IV rank, it does not take long for the IV to increase and the price to spike. 

Now low IV percentile does not guarantee a stock will explode to the upside. What the previous 3 examples had along with low IV was high open interest in the options chain. Institutions were accumulating options on those stocks during that time period. Currently, OG meme stock (GME, AMC, NOK, BB) option chains are brimming with open interest. Wyckoff and Pelosi lets me believe the volatility will be to the upside.  

*""Buy AMC, it will beat GME!!""*

##Last week, we all saw what the greatest trader in America's free market has purchased. 
From her holdings, Nancy Pelosi is bullish on 3 sectors:  
- tech/cloud =&gt; MU, GOOGL, CRM  
- metaverse =&gt; RBLX  
- reopening =&gt; DIS, REOF XX LLC (owns Marriott hotels)

If Pelosi is bullish on these 3 sectors, then there is no way they wouldn't be tendie machines in 2022 right? It just so happens GME fits as a metaverse and reopening play. It isn't a metaverse play yet though. GME plans for the metaverse are unknown outside of speculation, [but they do have something in motion](https://www.yahoo.com/now/gamestop-eyes-metaverse-hunt-ethereum-174139128.html). This could be a strong catalyst. &gt;!Hey look the 💍 chart is bull flagging while GME is consolidating. Could it be tha- oh fuck I'm out of tinfoil to wrap around my head.!&lt; 

Clearly, Nancy Pelosi thinks Omnicron is bullish. I am no doctor/scientist, but if she is willing to bet on Disney and Marriott hotels doing well this year then the heavily shorted retail stores may see upside as well. Good thing GME is a part of those too (XRT). A rising tide raises all ships.  

*""But but no business plan, they are burning cash, the fundament-""*   
Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? TSLA sure is worth $1000+ a share. RIVN is defintely worth $100+. Fundamentals will catch up eventually, but in the meantime this market moves on supply and demand. So fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink or yank rates back to the Volcker days. 

GME may not have the same reported short interest and retail interest as it did last year, but it has lower liquidity thanks to a cult locking up shares and better fundamental catalysts.

Now with gradually decreasing supply, if the overall retail interest were to return and bring back demand, GME could... Nevermind, you didn't hear it from me.   

*""A price run in GME would ignite the MOASS. Shorts never covered!!!""*

Sava has been cleared of any wrong-doing by two of the major research journals and resultantly both times Sava stock price jumped 50% to 100 percent in 1 day…. But the upcoming clearance from a major university will result in more than 300% price jump in one day. As per the allegations The City University of New York is investigating Dr Wang's research and will hopefully clear Dr Wang like all other research journals who on seeing original first hand data found no image manipulation. If no research journal is able to find any wrong-doing in Cassava sciences published research than CUNY, where the research is conducted, will also clear Dr Wang soon. And once this clearance is announced than short sellers will run with their shorts in their hands…. because after this there are no more allegations on SAVA. Sava will jump to at least 120 dollars per share on the announcement of Dr Wang clearance by City University of New York. And FDA is also expected to reject Citizen petition because the submitted petition is asking FDA to act beyond its laws to stop drug trials even when there are no safety issues reported… FDA can only stop trials if there are safety issues..",1641173411

Planet Labs $PL is an Earth Observation (EO) 🌍 space tech company pivoting to Software as a Service (SaaS) with a $600mn cash injection from their recent IPO to give them a 5 year ramp to turn from loss to profit whilst they continue to leverage and sell their existing 75PB data catalogue to create value added products using machine learning to provide curated information to agriculture, sustainability, defense, construction and FinTech.

They have already done the bulk of the necessary CapEx, since 2015 they have put up ~200 SuperDove cube satellites (micro sats) that scan the entire Earth surface every day creating a 3.5m resolution map of the entire globe in RGB+near infrared (for vegetation monitoring). They also have 21 taskable 0.5m resolution SkySats that offer a better temporal revisit and thus more flexibility than their competitors, even if those competitors offer slightly better imagery (Maxar/Airbus).

They hit their mission to scan the entire Earth surface in 2017 and have only gone on to expand since.

On Jan 22nd they are launching another 48 new and improved SuperDoves on a SpaceEx Falcon 9 so 🚀. I'm expecting this event may be a catalyst for price movement.

They're an SPAC and a small cap so the market hates them, on launch they plummeted from a $2.8bn valuation to $1.6bn after lowering Q4 guidance (yeah, not a particularly cool move).

That $2.8bn reflects their 2019 VC value of $2.2bn + $0.6bn in cash. Except they have nearly 50% more customers, over 1/3 more satellites and 30% higher revenues than 2019.

Currently they are trading at half that and ramping the business, with an additional 28 sales positions under the guidance of the Salesforce CEO.

Insiders have bought across the $6-7 range, and everything suggests this stock has a floor around $5.90.

Currently they are the only company with this kind of data set and they are in a unique position to leverage it to produce novel information for a diverse TAM they place at $100bn.

Whilst I can't guarantee this will to higher it definitely should, price targets have been reiterated at $14-16 and the company hasn't got any real competition. As an EO tech I see what they are doing and reckon this is a good one to follow for the next few years with huge growth potential.

It's currently losing money so should be valued way higher imo 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌍🚀🚀🚀🚀",1641169994

*""The squeeze squoze moron. What will be the catalyst even be this time?""*   
Fuck would I know what Ryan Cohen is cooking. (NFT Marketplace???) But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he is about to serve. 

Here. [Check a look at the amazing TA with GME sitting comfortably on the 2021 YTD VWAP](https://i.imgur.com/xl6BvYo.jpg).  

*Look at all those triangles. Mooooooon tomorrow!!!*  

You don't make financial decisions based on shapes do you? Well instead of displaying to you how two lines on a chart form a triangle, this DD will draw you lines but wrapped with theoretical bullshit containing Wyckoff Method, IV percentile, and Nancy Pelosi. 

## First, go educate yourself about the [Wyckoff Method](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).

Yeah, I wouldn't read that long ass article either.  
In short, the market can be understood and anticipated through analysis of supply and demand. Price cycles through accumulation, markup, distribution, and then markdown. Accumulation and distribution events can be illustrated in certain patterns. 

[Picture](https://i.imgur.com/XX369Uf.png)

This method was developed by Richard Wyckoff a century ago, who realized that stock price trends were driven primarily by institutional and other large operators who manipulate stock prices in their favor. Using Wyckoff's method, one can invest in stocks by capitalizing on the intentions of the large “smart money” interests, rather than being caught on the wrong side of the market.

Two patterns to know that your brain will filter regardless: [wrinkle1](https://i.imgur.com/HnRoUVN.png) , [wrinkle2](https://i.imgur.com/MCx85wM.png)

*""This Wackoff Method sounds some fringe TA/astrology mumbo jumbo.""*  
It sure is. Yet 100 years later, these tried and true accumulation/distribution patterns can still be observed today. 

1. [This guy predicted the May selloff with Wyckoff](https://i.imgur.com/WnlEuk4.jpg)

2. [Scored one of my best wins last year in the fall thanks to Wyckoff](https://i.imgur.com/1ztCaoj.png)

- [Now with our favorite stock](https://i.imgur.com/AmhdX8O.png)

I believe GME has just completed a spring/shakeout and the trend will gradually become bullish. Spring is a definitive test of available supply before a markup campaign unfolds. It may occur once a price advance has started, with rapid downward movement intended to induce retail traders and investors in long positions to sell their shares to large operators at bargain prices.   
But then again, I am a expert at wacking off, not Wyckoff.

*""Retail owns the float shill. Why would the hedgies want GME to rocket. It is us against the corrupt and fraudalent financial markets from the SEC to the DTCC.""*  
I agree fuck the gay bears and naked short selling. However, if you believe this is some David vs Goliath story like the media said in January, keep drinking that Koolaid. 

*""Institutions don't move/manipulate stock prices. You're spewing conspiracy crap.""*    
You must be from the same herd of sheep who believed WSB was the one to squeeze silver last February.   
 
*""GME moves in cycles bro, not some Wackoff baloney.""*  
Is GME a tampon? You shove GME in your portfolio one week, and then leave it out the next three?   
To be fair, I am not familiar with market mechanics such as FTD cycles. If the cycles have merit, then I would hope the next bullish momentum in phase D of Wyckoff aligns with the next cycle. 

##Low IV percentile typically provides a optimal environment for institutional sharks to feed.  

Most of the time, institutions aren't retarded like us. Most of the time. We ape into otm FDs on earnings day just to watch them get stomped on by IV the next day. Institutions buy options when the IV percentile is at or near the lowest, because that is when they are at a discount. 

Coincidentally when a stock's IV percentile is at its lowest, retail is the most bearish. A stock at a low IV percentile normally is consolidating and will starfish. Not talking about the sea creature. So the stock price lays flat, unmoving, and retail tends to get bored. They then pull out of their long positions to pump some hot flavor of the month stock with high IV. Meanwhile, institutions continue to add to their position. Hence inverse retail is a known strategy.

Theta gang finds this amusing though. So if any theta gang comes across this, fuck you you milquetoast asshats.  

Majority retail has become bearish on GME, which has starfished around the $180-$200 area for most of the year with a few spasms of volatility. Of course there remains a few enthusiasts, but let's just lock those animals up in a cage where they belong. If you talk to folk aside from them, most would say the stock is dead. In the past year, retail has been turned off to GME due to a combination of media bombardment of ""forget GME"" stories, getting burned by GME's volatility and new-age meme(scam) stocks like CLOV, and the fanaticism of QME members. 

It just so happens GME and other meme stocks are at or near their lowest IV percentile of the past year. Everything in the market moves in cycles. Periods of low volatility will become periods of high volatility. Here are a few examples last year:

1. [Tesla in the summer before the run to the $1000](https://i.imgur.com/jLIrA3L.png)

2. [AMC in the summer before the run to $70](https://i.imgur.com/zIIjuPd.png)

3. [MU in the fall](https://i.imgur.com/niAiF8S.png) 

- [GME now](https://i.imgur.com/ewPa5P0.png)

I do not believe the current lull in GME IV and other meme stocks will last forever. As you can see in the GME chart, whenever GME reaches a trough of low IV rank, it does not take long for the IV to increase and the price to spike. 

Now low IV percentile does not guarantee a stock will explode to the upside. What the previous 3 examples had along with low IV was high open interest in the options chain. Institutions were accumulating options on those stocks during that time period. Currently, OG meme stock (GME, AMC, NOK, BB) option chains are brimming with open interest. Wyckoff and Pelosi lets me believe the volatility will be to the upside.  

*""Buy AMC, it will beat GME!!""*  
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. You must really be taking a fat shit on the toilet. I'm still not done talking though, so don't wipe yet. 

##Last week, we all saw what the greatest trader in America's free market has purchased. 
From her holdings, Nancy Pelosi is bullish on 3 sectors:  
- tech/cloud =&gt; MU, GOOGL, CRM  
- metaverse =&gt; RBLX  
- reopening =&gt; DIS, REOF XX LLC (owns Marriott hotels)

If Pelosi is bullish on these 3 sectors, then there is no way they wouldn't be tendie machines in 2022 right? It just so happens GME fits as a metaverse and reopening play. It isn't a metaverse play yet though. GME plans for the metaverse are unknown outside of speculation, [but they do have something in motion](https://www.yahoo.com/now/gamestop-eyes-metaverse-hunt-ethereum-174139128.html). This could be a strong catalyst. &gt;!Hey look the 💍 chart is bull flagging while GME is consolidating. Could it be tha- oh fuck I'm out of tinfoil to wrap around my head.!&lt; 

Clearly, Nancy Pelosi thinks Omnicron is bullish. I am no doctor/scientist, but if she is willing to bet on Disney and Marriott hotels doing well this year then the heavily shorted retail stores may see upside as well. Good thing GME is a part of those too (XRT). A rising tide raises all ships.  

*""But but no business plan, they are burning cash, the fundament-""*   
Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? TSLA sure is worth $1000+ a share. RIVN is defintely worth $100+. Fundamentals will catch up eventually, but in the meantime this market moves on supply and demand. So fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink or yank rates back to the Volcker days. 

GME may not have the same reported short interest and retail interest as it did last year, but it has lower liquidity thanks to a cult locking up shares and better fundamental catalysts.

Now with gradually decreasing supply, if the overall retail interest were to return and bring back demand, GME could... Nevermind, you didn't hear it from me.   

*""A price run in GME would ignite the MOASS. Shorts never covered!!!""*  
[TOdAy'S ThE dAy !7!4!1!](https://i.imgur.com/qmoxd6r.png)

I believe GME has just completed a spring/shakeout and the trend will gradually become bullish. Spring is a definitive test of available supply before a markup campaign unfolds. It may occur once a price advance has started, with rapid downward movement intended to induce retail traders and investors in long positions to sell their shares to large operators at bargain prices.   
But then again, I am a expert at wacking off, not Wyckoff.

*""Retail owns the float shill. Why would the hedgies want GME to rocket. It is us against the corrupt and fraudalent financial markets from the SEC to the DTCC.""*  
I agree fuck the gay bears and naked short selling. However, if you believe this is some David vs Goliath story like the media said in January, keep drinking that Koolaid. 

*""Institutions don't move/manipulate stock prices. You're spewing conspiracy crap.""*    
You must be from the same herd of sheep who believed WSB was the one to squeeze silver last February.   
 
*""GME moves in cycles bro, not some Wackoff baloney.""*  
Is GME a tampon? You shove GME in your portfolio one week, and then leave it out the next three?   
To be fair, I am not familiar with market mechanics such as FTD cycles. If the cycles have merit, then I would hope the next bullish momentum in phase D of Wyckoff aligns with the next cycle. 

##Low IV percentile typically provides a optimal environment for institutional sharks to feed.  

Most of the time, institutions aren't retarded like us. Most of the time. We ape into otm FDs on earnings day just to watch them get stomped on by IV the next day. Institutions buy options when the IV percentile is at or near the lowest, because that is when they are at a discount. 

Coincidentally when a stock's IV percentile is at its lowest, retail is the most bearish. A stock at a low IV percentile normally is consolidating and will starfish. Not talking about the sea creature. So the stock price lays flat, unmoving, and retail tends to get bored. They then pull out of their long positions to pump some hot flavor of the month stock with high IV. Meanwhile, institutions continue to add to their position. Hence inverse retail is a known strategy.

Theta gang finds this amusing though. So if any theta gang comes across this, fuck you you milquetoast asshats.  

Majority retail has become bearish on GME, which has starfished around the $180-$200 area for most of the year with a few spasms of volatility. Of course there remains a few enthusiasts, but let's just lock those animals up in a cage where they belong. If you talk to folk aside from them, most would say the stock is dead. In the past year, retail has been turned off to GME due to a combination of media bombardment of ""forget GME"" stories, getting burned by GME's volatility and new-age meme(scam) stocks like CLOV, and the fanaticism of QME members. 

It just so happens GME and other meme stocks are at or near their lowest IV percentile of the past year. Everything in the market moves in cycles. Periods of low volatility will become periods of high volatility. Here are a few examples last year:

1. [Tesla in the summer before the run to the $1000](https://i.imgur.com/jLIrA3L.png)

2. [AMC in the summer before the run to $70](https://i.imgur.com/zIIjuPd.png)

3. [MU in the fall](https://i.imgur.com/niAiF8S.png) 

- [GME now](https://i.imgur.com/ewPa5P0.png)

I do not believe the current lull in GME IV and other meme stocks will last forever. As you can see in the GME chart, whenever GME reaches a trough of low IV rank, it does not take long for the IV to increase and the price to spike. 

Now low IV percentile does not guarantee a stock will explode to the upside. What the previous 3 examples had along with low IV was high open interest in the options chain. Institutions were accumulating options on those stocks during that time period. Currently, OG meme stock (GME, AMC, NOK, BB) option chains are brimming with open interest. Wyckoff and Pelosi lets me believe the volatility will be to the upside.  

*""Buy AMC, it will beat GME!!""*  
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

If you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. You must really be taking a fat shit on the toilet. I'm still not done talking though, so don't wipe yet. 

##Last week, we all saw what the greatest trader in America's free market has purchased. 
From her holdings, Nancy Pelosi is bullish on 3 sectors:  
- tech/cloud =&gt; MU, GOOGL, CRM  
- metaverse =&gt; RBLX  
- reopening =&gt; DIS, REOF XX LLC (owns Marriott hotels)

If Pelosi is bullish on these 3 sectors, then there is no way they wouldn't be tendie machines in 2022 right? It just so happens GME fits as a metaverse and reopening play. It isn't a metaverse play yet though. GME plans for the metaverse are unknown outside of speculation, [but they do have something in motion](https://www.yahoo.com/now/gamestop-eyes-metaverse-hunt-ethereum-174139128.html). This could be a strong catalyst. &gt;!Hey look the 💍 chart is bull flagging while GME is consolidating. Could it be tha- oh fuck I'm out of tinfoil to wrap around my head.!&lt; 

Clearly, Nancy Pelosi thinks Omnicron is bullish. I am no doctor/scientist, but if she is willing to bet on Disney and Marriott hotels doing well this year then the heavily shorted retail stores may see upside as well. Good thing GME is a part of those too (XRT). A rising tide raises all ships.  

*""But but no business plan, they are burning cash, the fundament-""*   
Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? TSLA sure is worth $1000+ a share. RIVN is defintely worth $100+. Fundamentals will catch up eventually, but in the meantime this market moves on supply and demand. So fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink or yank rates back to the Volcker days. 

GME may not have the same reported short interest and retail interest as it did last year, but it has lower liquidity thanks to a cult locking up shares and better fundamental catalysts.

Now with gradually decreasing supply, if the overall retail interest were to return and bring back demand, GME could... Nevermind, you didn't hear it from me.   

*""A price run in GME would ignite the MOASS. Shorts never covered!!!""*  
[TOdAy'S ThE dAy !7!4!1!](https://i.imgur.com/qmoxd6r.png)  
But hey you guys might be right and I fucking hope so. I wouldn't mind an early retirement. 

So you made it this far and are processing all this nonsense. Don't. Just do whatever the fuck you want. This is not financial advice silly. I am not a fuh-nancial advisor. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust.

9211,wallstreetbets,$AG JAN 21 '22 - OPTION FLOW - Gammasqueeze candidate,"Evening y'all,

While exploring option strategies of a range of stonks I got back to $AG. The target of the initial silver squeeze.

AGs option flow is a massacre. A huge amount of bullish call options deep OTM. Premium collected by market makers and a premium they are likely to cash-in.

However, this option structure holds a potential for a gamma squeeze potential.

Especially strike 12 is a keen candidate, with trending silver prices.

If AG gets above 12 USD, 25K call contracts turn ITM. The latter will make market makers to Delta hedge and buy buck the underlying shares (to make their sold calls - covered calls as such).

If silver trends, and AG catches a break, I see potential for a quick surge to 15 levels.

9222,wallstreetbets,When will market Manipulation end?,"So just going way back to the basics here. Stocks move based on supply and demand. So a lot of money buying a stock, an ETF, or whatever, the thing goes up. The opposite is true too. So to move, let’s say a stock an ETF or perhaps even the market, up or down, you just need a lot of money. Let’s say you need a ‘fuck ton’ of money. Let’s say you can move a fuck ton of money some how, well then you can move a stock, an ETF, or perhaps even the market. 

Alright well how do you get a fuck ton of money, enough to move the market you ask? Well here are some strategies in play today. 1) You’re a big ass institution like the banks, the hedge funds, the governments. You have a fuck ton of money you can move.
2) you have serious influence and can coordinate your followers by posts or whatever. 
Either way you move your fuck ton money I’m a specific way, perhaps have some in person conversation with your buds, then wait for the market to react, then take out your gains and chill for a bit while the people or entities who do not have, or have influence over, a fuck ton of money all shake their heads like why did this happen why did that happen. 

So the bullshit part that pisses me off is that this shit is baked in to the financial system. You can manipulate the market if you either have a fuck ton or money or you have influence over a fuck ton of money. Even the WSB GameStop AMC meme stock revolution, it was all based on “well the big institutions are moving their fuck ton of money around and screwing the folks without a fuck ton of money over (market manipulation), well if we all ban together we collectively have a fuck ton of money and we can move the market just like them.” Yes this works, obviously, but fuck people two wrongs don’t make a right. That’s little kid shit everyone can understand. It’s bullshit because if you had a crystal ball and could see the future to %99 accuracy you could take actions today and capitalize big just for knowing information others do not. That’s not a skill at all that’s just plotting and sacrificing others for your benefit. That’s like seeing someone drop their wallet right in front of you then picking it up quickly and being like sorry man I didn’t a wallet. It’s wrong, it’s bullshit, it’s market manipulation, and it’s baked into the worlds financial system.

 So a fuck ton money moves stocks, moves ETFs, can move the market. People, or groups of people, with a fuck ton of money or influence, can move money to get whatever future outcome they want. This is market manipulation at the highest most powerful level and it’s fucking wrong.

Oh and the appointed watch dogs who are suppose to keep an eye on market manipulation, they fucking don’t. Here’s a slap on the wrist and a fine not even big enough to make anyone blink. Oh by the way we should meet up for coffee, IN PERSON, and talk business. Oh and please don’t make me lose my job it’s easy as fuck because I jerk off all day and still make six figures. FCC or whatever the fuck their name is. Useless fuck heads who do not protect the average investor as at all. 

These fucking big ass institutions. Fuck you, you shit the bed.

These assholes with clout that influence big money and fuck over everyone else. Fuck you, you shit the bed.

So my question stands, when will market manipulation end?

9239,wallstreetbets,A to B trading. The death-knell of predatory algorithms in the US stock market,"\-This is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

\-This is a tutorial on how to take advantage of the opportunity that predatory algorithms present when 2 or more instruments are being manipulated in tandem by the same algorithm.

\-When I refer to stock in this short tutorial,  I am referring to any instrument that is being algorithmically manipulated

\-I do not trade for dollars.   I trade for increased position.  Not money.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Scenario:  Stock A and B are joined together by an algorithm.  

&amp;#x200B;

As stock A and B move, gaps open and close in both directions, creating opportunity on an industrial scale.

&amp;#x200B;

Take price samples of both stocks, and divide the stock prices into each other.  

&amp;#x200B;

By taking price samples at regular intervals of both stocks, whether it be every minute, or every 5 minutes, you will see the algorithm expanding and contracting between the two instruments.

&amp;#x200B;

As you become aware of the flow of the algorithm, by tracking the results of the division of the two stock prices,  you will see opportunities to increase your position in the other stock by as much as 10-25%,  by selling the one you have, and buying the other for its increased position. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example:  \*FOR EXAMPLE ONLY - NOT REAL\*  Ticker symbol NTES ($101.78) is married by algo to ticker symbol BBIO ($16.86).

&amp;#x200B;

BBIO divides into NTES = 6.03.   5 minutes pass and NTES is now $103.90 and BBIO is $16.81.  This = 6.18.  A 2.18% increase.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the number you track to determine when is the best time to sell one, and buy the other.  (I try to stay above 10% position increase)

&amp;#x200B;

Hold until its time to increase position in the other when the division is in your favor, and to your liking.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

\*The key for optimal gains\*\*,  When the stocks are trading sideways or trending downward, so as to try and avoid making profits on the sale, and only increase position. 

&amp;#x200B;

It does not matter the instrument type.  If it is married to another instrument by an algorithm, positions can be gained at little to no cost.

&amp;#x200B;

The more stocks that are being run on the same algorithm, the more opportunity to create a better position through choice.

They have over 50 partners, with 8 of the 10 top automakers in the world, including a partnership with Volvo where their technology will be **standardized** in their 2022 XC 90 series. 

The company went public via SPAC last year and got to a sky high market cap of $11B with no commercialization sales. 2021 was the year of rotation out of growth stocks so it became an easy target for short sellers and bears. It's now back down to Earth with a market cap of just under $6B. 

Given the fact that one of the top automakers in the world is standardizing their product into their cars, that seems to me like the product works. And if it works, it's a game changer for safety. 

I believe we are still a decade or two away from human drivers being completely taken out of the equation, so there is currently an opportunity to make semi-autonomous driving even safer. LAZR is the top dog in the space and it me, it's undervalued.

9316,wallstreetbets,LAZR (Luminar) 2022 discussion,"Here we go, boys. This will be my first post that’s not hardcore loss porn or a meme of sorts. I’m about to break it down for y’all. 

LAZR (Luminar) is an automotive lidar company that creates hardware and software for passenger and commercial vehicles. Out of all the public lidar companies, LAZR (**to me**) is in the best position to capture market share and may be the only one to achieve commercialization this year through its partnership with Volvo (more on that later).

The company went public last year through a SPAC merger and found itself with an $11B market cap before the end of 2020. Talk about a hot commodity.

Long story short, the stock price has been tanking ever since. LAZR seems to have been caught in sector rotation away from growth stocks the last year, as it is mostly a pre-revenue company. Its sky high, bubble-like valuation left it an easy target for short sellers and bears.

Fast forward to December 2021 when the company announced plans to buy back stock.

Now, I am generally neutral on insider buys. I’ve been burned many times basing investment decisions on timing insider buys so I don’t like to put much into it as an act, but shit, when the entire management team gets together and agrees that that the market has inefficiently priced shares of the company they run, it’s worth a double take. The company recently announced a buy back of $300M of stock, call options with $30 strike (expiration unknown? Most likely Jan 2023), as well as putting in place plans for the management team to purchase shares on the open market. That is interesting. 

This is a good time to bring up the whiz kid founder and CEO, Austin Russell. This guy created the company in 2012 at age 16 or some shit, dropped out of college after getting a Peter Thiel grant or sum shit, and recently bought a mega mansion for $83 millski. It’s not unreasonable at this point to say:

“OP, why would the CEO of a ‘pre-revenue’ company like LAZR buy an absurdly ridiculous over-the-top mansion? Isn’t that a red flag?”

To which I would reply, “Yes, my guy. I’m not cool with that.”

I don’t agree with the move. But I don’t need to. This Elon Musk-type whiz kid has far more money than me and is wildly more successful, at a younger age. Guy’s a self-made billionaire of a seemingly legitimate business and things are looking bright. So why not? Do your thing, Austin.

Many of you TSLA bros are probably aware of Elon’s take on lidar. He sees it as unnecessary. “A fool’s errand” actually, and “anyone relying on lidar is doomed”. To me, Elon has proven himself enough times to take notice of what he’s saying. Here is the link for anyone who hasn’t seen it:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM23sjhtk4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM23sjhtk4Q)

Elon’s the GOAT. The man operates on a different level. However, when I watch that video, to me, his argument sounds like “Businessman” Elon rather than “Engineer” Elon. This video gives me the feeling of a defense of Tesla’s strategy to rely on cameras and vision more so than a reasonable knock on lidar tech in general. Maybe I’m wrong but that’s how it sounds to me.

The other thing to consider here is LAZR is not trying to create a fully autonomous vehicle with their lidar alone. Their goal is simply to **decrease** the amount of accidents on the roads each year. With lidar, objects and hazards can be detected further in advance than what the human eye can see, and using it, decisions can be made either by the driver or the car to account for the data. Rather than trying to copy Tesla’s goal of creating a fully autonomous car, LAZR is simply trying to bridge the gap in safety for semi-autonomy (right now).

That’s HUGE in considering LAZR as an investment. IMO, we are still a decade or two away from human drivers being taken out of the equation completely. This is an opportunity that I believe LAZR is in the best position to take advantage of.

Now to bring up their partnerships, which are numerous (over 50 total, with 8 out of 10 top automakers). The biggest and most well-known one is with Volvo. LAZR was chosen to be **STANDARDIZED** in Volvo’s 2022 XC 90 series. Notice the capitalized and bolded word there - **STANDARDIZED**. Meaning it’s not an option. Godamn, Volvo. That’s big. That’s an investment in the future. In safety. In trusting a 20-something whiz kid with an $83 millski house. They’ve even found a way to incorporate the hardware in a sexy way.

As you can see, that’s a sleek design. Far better than what we all imagine when we think of lidar and all the shit attached to the roof of the car. I like that looks of it.

At this point, you might be saying to yourself, “This guy provided literally no pertinent or useful information in this post. No hard numbers, projections, nothing. It’s all speculation. Why the fuck should I listen to WSB’s worst investor?” (See my previous loss porn posts)

It also seems like something a hedge fund would do to garner support from rich/seasoned, non-retarded investors.

Many of you TSLA bros are probably aware of Elon’s take on lidar. He sees it as unnecessary. “A fool’s errand” actually, and “anyone relying on lidar is doomed”. To me, Elon has proven himself enough times to take notice of what he’s saying. Here is the link for anyone who hasn’t seen it:

Elon’s the GOAT. The man operates on a different level. However, when I watch that video, to me, his argument sounds like “Businessman” Elon rather than “Engineer” Elon. This video gives me the feeling of a defense of Tesla’s strategy to rely on cameras and vision more so than a reasonable knock on lidar tech in general. Maybe I’m wrong but that’s how it sounds to me.

The other thing to consider here is LAZR is not trying to create a fully autonomous vehicle with their lidar alone. Their goal is simply to **decrease** the amount of accidents on the roads each year. With lidar, objects and hazards can be detected further in advance than what the human eye can see, and using it, decisions can be made either by the driver or the car to account for the data. Rather than trying to copy Tesla’s goal of creating a fully autonomous car, LAZR is simply trying to bridge the gap in safety for semi-autonomy (right now).

That’s HUGE in considering LAZR as an investment. IMO, we are still a decade or two away from human drivers being taken out of the equation completely. This is an opportunity that I believe LAZR is in the best position to take advantage of.

Now to bring up their partnerships, which are numerous (over 50 total, with 8 out of 10 top automakers). The biggest and most well-known one is with Volvo. LAZR was chosen to be **STANDARDIZED** in Volvo’s 2022 XC 90 series. Notice the capitalized and bolded word there - **STANDARDIZED**. Meaning it’s not an option. Godamn, Volvo. That’s big. That’s an investment in the future. In safety. In trusting a 20-something whiz kid with an $83 millski house. They’ve even found a way to incorporate the hardware in a sexy way.

9349,wallstreetbets,LAZR (Luminar) 2 the Moon? Maybe?,"Here we go, boys. This will be my first post that’s not hardcore loss porn or a meme of sorts. I’m about to break it down for y’all. This post is about LAZR.

LAZR (Luminar) is an automotive lidar company that creates hardware and software for passenger and commercial vehicles. Out of all the public lidar companies, LAZR is in the best position to capture market share and may be the only one to achieve commercialization this year through its partnership with Volvo (more on that later).

The company went public last year through a SPAC merger and found itself with an $11B market cap before the end of 2020. Talk about a hot commodity.

Long story short, the stock price has been tanking ever since. LAZR seems to have been caught in sector rotation away from growth stocks the last year, as it is mostly a pre-revenue company. Its sky high, bubble-like valuation left it an easy target for short sellers and bears.

Fast forward to December 2021 when the company announced plans to buy back stock.

Now, I am generally neutral on insider buys. I’ve been burned many times basing investment decisions on timing insider buys so I don’t like to put much into it as an act, but shit, when the entire management team gets together and agrees that that the market has inefficiently priced shares of the company they run, it’s worth a double take. The company recently announced a buy back of $300M of stock, call options with $30 strike (expiration unknown? Most likely Jan 2023), as well as putting in place plans for the management team to purchase shares on the open market. That is interesting. V interesting.

This is a good time to bring up the whiz kid founder and CEO, Austin Russell. This guy created the company in 2012 at age 16 or some shit, dropped out of college after getting a Peter Thiel grant or sum shit, and recently bought a mega mansion for $83 millski. It’s not unreasonable at this point to say:

“OP, why would the CEO of a ‘pre-revenue’ company like LAZR buy an absurdly ridiculous over-the-top mansion? Isn’t that a red flag?”

To which I would reply, “Yes, my guy. I’m not cool with that.”

Saving and investing has become a crucial topic among female communities. Many realise that because women’s life expectancy is longer, they need more long-term savings. However, they might have missed the opportunity to invest in the longest bull market in history due to the wage gap. 

On average, women earn 20% less than men in the same positions, thus have less disposable income to invest. Making things worse, the Covid crisis aggravated the gender inequality crisis, as it was disproportionately women who left their jobs to take care of children during the lockdowns. Because of the pandemic, it will now take 135.6 years to close the gender pay gap, versus 99.5 years before Covid, according to the World Economic Forum. 



Women are not willing to wait any longer. Tired of the lack of progress, 2022 sees a massive grass-roots effort based on social media platforms to force companies that break civil rights laws to address unfair and sexist, racist, ageist and ableist practices. 


Although women have been struggling with lower salaries they have higher saving rates than men. Those savings will now come in handy as they decide to take the situation into their own hands and throw their considerable influence around in a #metoo movement in financial markets. 

In contrast to the often-nihilistic original Reddit Army, the Women’s Reddit Army will be more sophisticated, with women traders coordinating a long squeeze by shorting stocks of selected patriarch companies. 


At the same time, they will direct funds to companies with the best metrics on female representation in middle management and among executives. Instead of condemning the development, politicians worldwide welcome and support their cause, putting even more pressure on companies with outdated patriarchal attitudes, poor gender equality in pay, and under-representation of women on boards and in management to address the errors of their ways. 

**Market impact: The movement gets real results as the broader market catches on to the theme and joins in, forcing targeted company prices sharply lower, which sees companies scrambling to change their ways. It marks the beginning of a gender parity renaissance in markets. **",1641143863

9357,wallstreetbets,Lets rethink NFTs for music...,"With the rise of streaming, the music industry changed rapidly in the last years. While music is more accessible than ever before, it is getting more and more difficult for artists to maintain a sustainable career.

Artists currently are mostly dependent on labels investing in their career and helping them to pay for marketing, studio costs etc.  


With blockchain we have the chance to change that. We can take away the decision power from the huge corporate labels and give it back to the fans enabling the artists to stay independent.

The concept is that an artist is creating a limited amount of Artist-NFTs that their fans are able to buy. This is direct cash-flow for the artist, without the involvement of any labels or publishers. The fans will benefit from the rising value of the artists NFTs with the career of the musician taking off.

As the artist will be connected to his fans via the NFTs he will also be able to give additional perks like, guestlist, private events, exclusive material, meet-and-greets and whatever he can think of.

We are close to finishing up the first version of the platform and are soon testing with selected waitlist users. We really want to connect with you guys on Reddit because it is a direct and uncomplicated way to get real and honest feedback from people who would really benefit from this, so we are really grateful that we have the chance to talk to you as a community.

We would love to hear your ideas and can't wait to get a discussion going. You can get early access on songtape.com to stay in the loop.

I am an Electronics Engineer in Aerospace/telecom. I am sure this is not news but we are all seeing strange movements in electronic parts supply chains. Something that stands out to me is the suppression of the US supply chain to support a free (as in freedom) Linux cell phone.

To combat this suppression, Purism has created an investment option called a conversion note where you can help them combat the suppression of their US supply chain. You can read about it linked.

Wondering your thoughts on this as an investment.

9418,wallstreetbets,Why the HIMX Bull Run is Just Getting Started,"I’ve been getting a lot of DMs lately asking when I’m going to sell or responses to my posts asking how much more profit I think I can make or just saying no thanks I’ll wait for the next dip. I’m writing this post because this stock has already changed my life and I’d love if more of us could have that experience.

I’ve said multiple times that if Himx runs from its current price of 16 to 25 by august 2022 and Himx earnings stay flat for the next 3 quarters at 0.80 per share, which I highly doubt, it’s trailing pe at that time would be 7.8125. This is for a high growth fabless semiconductor tech company. In the end though I was using the 25$ price target because another Himx bull had thrown it out as a worst case number. Next let’s take two scenarios where we compare it to traditional established company estimates and then to a company that’s almost a mirror of Himx in its industry.

There is an old rule that established tech companies that are still growing well (not anywhere as fast as Himx though) should trade at a pe of 20 although I’d argue with all the retail money that has joined the markets in the past two years the new rule prob should be closer to 25 but let’s use 20 to be conservative. 

The last 4 earnings for Himx was 0.80, 0.62, 0.38, and 0.20 or $2.00 for the trailing twelve months. At 15.99 that puts current pe right at 8 but to trade at fair value for a slower growing tech company at a trailing pe of 20 then right now Himx should be at $40 share price and this is the conservative estimate 

The last 7 earnings for Himx have been 0.80, 0.62, 0.38, 0.20, 0.07, 0.01, 0.02. I show the last seven quarters because after they showed the 0.20 eps that quarter, the stock jumped to 16$, the same as it’s current price. Then the short position started growing like crazy and the stock tanked. Right before getting shorted when at a $16 share price it was trading at a trailing pe of 53.33 which is actually pretty appropriate in my opinion and according to industry comparisons. But more importantly look at the eps growth in the 3 quarters since then.

Marvell another fabless semiconductor company in my opinion is almost identical to Himax in moat, verticals, market share, growth etc. and makes for an almost perfect case study for Himx.

The last 4 quarters for Marvell have shown an eps of 0.43, 0.34, 0.29, 0.29. That’s a trailing twelve month earnings of $1.35. It closed at a price of 87.49. That puts its trailing pe at 64.81.

So if trailing pe was a mega conservative 20 like more established low growth tech then Himx should trade today at $40 (In august of 2022 with flat growth this should trade at $64 if trailing pe were 20). If it matched its growth pe, prior to the short attacks, of 53.33 then it would trade today at $106.66. Finally if it traded at a similar growth pe to its closest competitor in its industry that has similar albeit slower growth and similar dominant market share in its area of the semiconductor industry then it would trade today at $129.62.

This is why I’m not selling and why most of my original investment in HIMX is in Jan 2023 and Jan 2024 LEAPS. Even my expansion last week into this was still 70% shares and LEAPS.


Here is some of my original DD;
Himax is a fabless semiconductor company that specializes in display drivers. They currently have significant sales in phones, tablets, monitors, vr, televisions, and automotive. They are a technical leader in this field. In the last two weeks at a conference the ceo of continental hyped their relationship (continental is a supplier to almost every major tier 1 automaker in the world). As screens dominate modern cars and utilize more technology the number of display drivers needed per screen and number of screens per car (center console screen, hud, 2-4 screens for the hellions in the back) will rapidly increase. This is the highest margin vertical of Himx business and they are shifting production towards this sector. Also Himx secured long term supply chain contracts with foundries ensuring they will have access to a lot more silicon in 2022 allowing them to grow revenue and maintain technical dominance and market share in this fast growing sector. They already supply tier ones in Japan, south Korea, Europe and the USA. Their latest display driver has one of the most advanced local dimming features critical for high contrast conditions and yet it’s one of the lowest power options on the market. 

This semiconductor company has a 75%+ yoy growth like many companies during this time frame but this wasn’t during a downturn but a period of high growth. The key is their sequential or quarter over quarter revenue and earnings growth. They have posted 4 straight quarters of 15%+ qoq or sequential growth. Eps went from 0.62 to 0.80. Gross margin expanded from 47.5% to 51.7% sequentially. 

As of Monday it trades with a trailing pe of 6.14 and forward pe of 4.64. This is lower pe then other companies only growing 1% yoy.  Hell if their eps stayed flat for the next 3 quarters at 0.80 and the stock went from 15 to 25 then it’s trailing pe at that time would still only be 7.8125 

One of the chairmen with the most shares in the company recently announced he was buying another 10M worth of shares using his personal funds.

Now the short % is 14% of outstanding shares and 21% of float. This is an opportunity to buy a growing company with awesome fundamentals that could easily double by 2023 or even squeeze and double much sooner. 

Sorry for being so excited about this stock. I had a small position growing since October. In nov I tax loss harvested and doubled my position. I doubled my position again just last week. Friday I ended the day up 23.9k and was up 17k the day before that and there is still so much value left in this company. This has been life changing for me personally and I’m hoping more of you can see the value in Himx and also have a life changing experience. Hopefully we can all make some money together by following the fundamentals.

This is not financial advice and I have shares and 2023 and 2024 leaps.

Good luck and as always do your own dd.",1641138708

9468,wallstreetbets,Asset Allocation for Young People,"Yes, young people have to focus on asset allocation too.  Here are some questions all of us need to consider when it comes to our investments:

* How old are you?
* When will you need the money?
* Will you consider Hedge Funds?
* Will you consider REITs?
* Will you consider Commodities?
* Will you consider International Investing?
* What is the value of your investment portfolio?
* How much do you save a year?
* What percent of your savings is in tax-deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs, 401(k)s, or 403(b)s?
* How many people, such as a child, spouse, or aging parent, are financially dependent on you?
* What percent of your investments do you plan to spend over the next 3 years?
* What percent of your investments do you plan to spend over the next 10 years?
* How much equity do you have in your home, or do you rent?
* What is your marginal federal tax rate?
* How much volatility can you live with?
* What is the reading over the U.S. economy over the next 12 months?

Assuming that one has a young 22-year old, fresh out of college who rents, and has no investible assets. Retirement is a long time away. I came up with this as an example:

* Cash 1%
* Cash Equivalents 7.3%
* Bonds 2.8%
* Large Cap 21.8%
* Mid Cap 18.4%
* Small-Cap 15.0%
* Developed Markets 6.8%
* Emerging Markets 4.5%
* Real Estate 3.7%
* Commodities 3.7%
* Hedging Strategies 15.0%

In the book Ellis talks about a rule Jefferson had for dealing with the British and his mistrust of them toward the former colonies during this time. I believe he could have used this to describe most of WSB. 

Excerpt from the book, in the chapter discussing Jeffersons’s time in Paris between 1784-89:

“Jefferson claimed he had an infallible rule for deciding what that nation, England, would do on every occasion. It was a simple rule namely, “To consider what they ought to do and to take the reverse of that as what they would assuredly do”. He claimed that by adopting this formula he was never deceived.”

Another is Adecco which is listed in Switzerland as more of a HR company, bought General Assembly back in 2018 but even that is a stretch given Adecco does all sorts of other stuff.

Why so much open interest for JAN,21 2022","Full disclosure, i was assigned 1200 shares of ZNGA and was trying to figure out my exit strategy after rolling a put spread for months. The spread was for Jan 21 and was assigned on NYE. So my loss is minimal and I’m not worried. 

While looking through their option chain I found that the open interest is huge compared to other dates. 380,000 plus compared to about 10-20k normally. 

I went looking through the news and Matt Wolf, the VP of block chain gaming for the company said they are going to be releasing NFTs early this year. Anyone find the open interest extremely weird or what?",1641110447

Given: Video clip about 4 very famous YouTubers in the world of finance. Each of them has about 3 million subscribers. The clip will be humorous. Lots of cool animations. Spent 100 hours editing, etc.

Objective: at the time of the release of the video to receive an ""explosion"" of attention, the target audience of the American financial YouTube segment. Get 100K views at least.

The question is how to do it correctly? What are the patterns for launching such projects?

From what I've already found (my ideas):

\- 7 days before the release, upload very short teasers, inflating advertisements in FB, YouTube on these teasers  
\- Show the Backstage of making a clip without revealing the clip itself ...  
\- Ask smaller YouTubers in this niche to make an announcement? (wat is the reason to help me?).

# 4 New de-SPACs for 2021 ($ARVL)

There’s no investment advice here. If that’s what you’re looking for, then off you fuck.

Spotted an error? Good for you. Don’t like something? Unless it’s celery that you don’t like then I don’t care. If it is celery you don’t like then you can be my friend.

**There’s a fuck ton of personal opinion in this. Deal with it.**

This ain’t no due diligence. If you want to be duly diligent about something then make it about the route you take walking away from here.

Anyway, that’s the niceties over and done with, so here we go……

Arrival ($ARVL)

4 new products promised: a 4.25 ton delivery van (Q3 ‘22), a “large” van, a bus (Q2 ‘22) and a car primarily designed for ride hailing (Q3 ‘23).

Number of employees: &gt;2,400 at Q3 report date

HQ: UK, London

Mkt Cap: \~$5bn (NASDAQ)

Battery Supplier: Cells from LG Chem, battery packs assembled in-house.

Planned Production Sites: US x2, UK x1, Spain x1

Pre-orders: **&gt;64,000 units** including **10,000 vans** to UPS (total also may include options for an additional 10,000 units), \~**7,700 buses** and **3,000 vans** to Lease Plan. All done through MOUs, LOIs etc. All orders appear to be cancellable / non-binding.

Major investors pre-SPAC: Black Rock (€98.8m), Hyundai Kia (€98.3m), UPS (€9.8m), WCPF II (€49.2m).

Short Positions: \~10% with \~5.5 days cover

**Summary**

$ARVL is attempting to gain value by a unique, highly automated, micro factory production model with a capacity of 10,000 units per microfactory. Although there is scant evidence that it’s close to being ready (and a lot more evidence that it’s behind schedule and over cost), if the low-cost and low capex production system works then it will set $ARVL up with a potentially highly profitable business. It wouldn't be outside the realms of reality for it to take a lot more time for the production system to work effectively, however, the Bus may well be easily assembled by hand, giving a source of revenue. The Van products would likely be more heavily affected by a lack of automation (a bus is large, but will have proportionately less parts on it for its size compared to a van, and therefore you can have more people working on assembling it)

They’ve gone for a lot of vertical integration in their parts without stating which parts they are designing, which although gives greater flexibility on design and better control over costs, it also forces all liability onto them as well. With no history of vehicles on the road, this could be seen as a cost risk once vehicles are in-market. Unique technology includes an impressive, in house, carbon composite used for exterior panels.

Vehicles are designed to not need stamping, welding and paint facilities which reduces CAPEX requirements for production facilities. Without stamping it will remove a normally very high cost burden in vehicle design as well.

Even with 2,400 employees, 4 vehicles is a lot to be working on simultaneously, and while trying to establish 4 micro factories and designing homegrown components, any delays in generating revenue are likely to strain cash reserves, despite what was generated through the SPAC process and subsequent bonds and follow-on share offerings.

The Q4 report is going to be critical. Revenue targets for 2023 given during the SPAC process were withdrawn in the Q3 report. If it doesn’t have A LOT of good news and revenue targets for 2023 then the share price is likely to take a hit, especially since ***they aim to be at full production capacity in Q1 2023*** \- in 12 months time.

Next $ARVL Report: Q4 results, approx Mid Feb 2022

Must Have:

* Positive news about a working microfactory, with a definitive **date for finishing commissioning** and **preferably** the **percentage of build automation that they are able to achieve**
* Confirmation of a start date for the First Group bus trial.
* Reintroduction of sales volume and revenue estimates for 2023

Hope for:

* An update on progress of the Bus proving ground trials, with numbers to support the information
* No further microfactory announcements without confirmation that the first two are operational and effective.

Vehicles - Market and Engineering viewpoint and opinion. Take it or leave as you will. I don’t give a shit either way!

**Bus:**

$ARVL have stated that of approx 64k pre-orders as of Q3 report date, 12% of these are buses. With a price target to be “competitive with diesel” equivalents, and a diesel bus in Europe costing in the range of €200,000, that gives a loose revenue projection in the range of €1.5bn for this product, though it’ll likely take a while to produce over 7k buses.

The pricing of the bus is worth noting: if $ARVL can truly make an EV bus for €200k and make money on it, and other European EV bus manufacturers are selling at double that price, then $ARVL not only has scope to significantly increase their price to generate more profit and revenue, they can do it while still undercutting their competitors. Cities across Europe and other geographic areas are driving the requirement for zero emissions buses, so demand will be there with an expectation that they’re expensive.

On December 28th, the company announced that proving ground trials had begun, hence meeting their objective to start trials in Q4…..just. The timing, 3 days before the end of the quarter, seems a bit too convenient to be fully truthful!

On-road trials are scheduled to begin in the UK with First Group in Q1 2022, giving them until the end March to start.

If the proving ground trials which involve “rigorous validation and testing ahead of certification” (which doesn’t mean anything in engineering terms - it’s likely to be an accelerated durability test as per the Van announcement, along with whatever certification tests they want to do before the official tests) started late December it’ll several months to complete - approximately 2 to 6 months depending on exactly what they’re doing - assuming there aren’t any major issues. However, major issues for a new product from a new company are absolutely to be expected. By the time these issues have been investigated, part revisions designed, engineered and produced, then retrofitted onto vehicles, it will add a significant chunk of time onto the schedule to start the First Group trial. The only other alternative is to start the trial on schedule but proceed with known risk(s) of failure which could ultimately hurt their chances of picking up sales from First Group.

They also have plans on the US bus market as well. Comments made during a meeting to discuss the SPAC with CIIG included “An electric bus in the US generally sells at around $750 thousand dollars. A diesel bus generally sells for $450 thousand dollars. We expect to produce an electric-powered “better” bus for less than $450 thousand dollars with an attractive operating margin”. They announced an order for 5 buses from Anaheim, CA in July 2021.

**Conclusion:** Massive potential revenue and profit, but it’ll likely be slow to get into market in any volume.

**Car:**

In May 2021 they announced a “collaboration” with Uber to produce a ride-hailing focussed vehicle for the UK and EU markets. There is no indication of any money exchanging hands or orders being placed for this, rather that they are “exploring strategic partnerships” so it would appear to be more of a marketing arrangement for the time being, rather than anything else. That may change.

Uber has stated that they are targeting all city based vehicles to be zero-emission by 2025 as part of their Clean Air Plan, and have been growing a fund to assist drivers with the cost of changing their vehicles. Uber already has EVs from most of the major manufacturers on their allowed-vehicles list. Given the current waiting times for the most popular EVs (anecdotally upto a year for the VW ID4), a late 2023 SOP date may not be harmful to $ARVL.

The success of the $ARVL car will come down to costs. Any standard passenger car sale is sensitive to total cost of ownership (excl ultra premium and sports cars). That includes not just day-to-day running costs, but also residual value. But herein lies the problem - a new vehicle from an unknown manufacturer is likely to have a very low residual value as there’s little demand in the second hand market for an unknown brand car, which in turn pushes up lease costs. If the vehicle is further being used to generate income (i.e. from ridehail drivers) then it’s unlikely to be purchased / leased unless it’s at a compelling price. Their solution to this may be to offer a guaranteed minimum buy-back price after any lease finishes. That would control the residual price but at the same time give them a significant cost burden if they can’t then subsequently re-lease the vehicles as “used” or sell them for a sensible price in the open market.

They “revealed” an Alpha prototype of the Car in a video on December 16th 2021 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv5vS2ZNgfA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv5vS2ZNgfA)).

It’s difficult to tell from the information available how “premium” the car is, but as a rough guideline, there’s the sliding scale relationship between sales volume and price / profitability - as with most stuff - you either produce very high volume at low margin per vehicle (Fiat 500), or you slide up the scale towards very low volume / very high margin (Mercedes S Class). So the question is, where on the scale is the $ARVL car? Since there’s no data on range, battery options, mass, drive train, equipment, performance and only an implication on overall size (“the footprint of a VW Golf”), and no real interior shots, it’s not really possible to draw any firm conclusions. From what’s in the video, it looks like they’ve followed the Tesla approach of ultra-minimalist (read: cheap), though that doesn’t infer anything about cost. In any case, they’ll probably need to offer the vehicle at a hefty discount vs the price of whatever vehicle(s) they’ve defined as the competitor(s).

It’s probably also worth saying that they have made a point of the amount of space in the rear - in this engineer’s opinion, while it’s not a bad thing, it’s not a good sales point either. There are plenty of passenger cars in the market which have a lot of rear space but few of them are currently in use throughout most of Europe as passenger car based Ubers. There are however quite a few examples of failed vehicles which were marketed as having a lot of rear space……

The boot (trunk) also looks quite small in terms of ground area and is awkwardly shaped (basically it’s a small ground area but very tall).

I’d also be interested to see what the final seat design is. For their sake, my hope is that they’ve gone for an existing seat design from a large supplier, trimmed to an $ARVL spec. Seats are notoriously difficult to design due to safety constraints, and the ones in the video look unique to me.

**Conclusion:** It’s an odd mix of the back of a London Taxi without the passenger carrying capacity, and the external appearance of a slightly squashed 1980s Renault Espace. Unless they can sell them at a bizarrely high profit (&gt;&gt;100% COP), I suspect they’re heading down the wrong path with this one. Even with a high margin, volumes may well be limited to a few hundred units a year at most. They’ve said that the 2022 focus is on Bus and Van so resources on it may be limited.

**Van(s)**

There’s little information on the large van, and no published split between the sizes in pre-orders. In the car video (above) there is a large van with awkwardly small wheels, in the background. This could be it, done as an easter egg in the video, but I’m not entirely trusting that this hasn’t been staged to give some misleading information.

Electric vans in Europe which are over 4,250kg GVW require different driving license entitlements - the next license category goes up to 7,500kg GVW (that I know of, there’s no weight extension for EVs in this weight class). I would therefore expect this van to have a maximum of a 7,500kg GVW. At over 7,500kg, there aren’t really any “vans” in the market - they’re trucks of various sorts. There’s no other published information that I could find.

The smaller van has been through a major design iteration since it was first unveiled as a “Postman Pat” van in \~2019 (look it up if you’re not British). The latest version was shown in March 2021 and promises to have a Gross Vehicle Weight of minimum 3,500kg to max 4,250kg which makes it driveable in Europe on a car driving license. However, payload is a key driver for commercial vehicle sales. This varies from 567kg to 1,840kg depending on the configuration. That’s ahead of Ford’s ambition for the e-Transit.

Vehicle efficiency will affect the total range / payload - there’s not enough information available to conclude anything in this area.

The market for electric commercial vans in the EV 4,250kg category is undoubtedly increasing, but is still a limited market. 2020 sales of these e-Vans totalled around 8,000 units across the EU, UK and Norway.

Leader of the pack is Mercedes with the e-Vito (3,200kg GVW), who claimed only 2,318 sales in 2020. The second biggest selling van was the Mercedes e-Sprinter (3,500kg GVW) with 1,836 units.

If only 14% of the 56k van pre-orders are for the European 4.25T van, then they are poised to almost immediately take a &gt;50% market share. But for that, they have to convert pre-orders into order contracts, and get production out quickly. Neither of these things is an easy thing to do with a new product and production process.

There is no pricing information available, but as with the Bus, they are saying that it is “equivalent to a diesel” van. The market leading diesel is the Ford Transit (&gt;1500,000 annual sales) with prices from \~€20k. The pricing of the e-Vito starts from \~€49k, and the e-Sprinter from \~€66k. This gives $ARVL some significant margin to play with pricing and still undercut competitors for around 24 months after launch. There’s an expectation that electric vans will reach a price parity with diesels around 2024/5 - this is likely partly to come from price increases on the diesel vans, and price decreases on EVs, and depending on how it’s measured, any market dominance from $ARVL could also bring down the weighted average.

**Conclusion:** Looks good. Actually, very good. Entry timing into the market is about right to start making an impact before an inevitable explosion in market demand. Pricing for anything other than very large orders (which they’ve already got) being on a par with entry price diesels seems unlikely, with residuals becoming less of a concern for these orders. Thumbs up.

**Production**

4 vehicle assembly locations have been announced, along with 2 battery pack assembly facilities.

These are:

Rock Hill, SC, USA: Bus

West Charlotte, NC, USA: Vans + batteries

Bicester, UK: Vans

Madrid, Spain: Van(s)

There is also another Battery facility which is only stated to be in the UK. It would make sense for that to either be in Bicester or Banbury (where an R&amp;D facility is). They’re only about 20 miles apart.

The production concept is to use small footprint “microfactories” and use robotic assembly cells to put vehicles together. This gives a low capex to set up a factory (they claim $43m), low opex and no specialist building required. $ARVL claim they can convert an existing warehouse type building into a functional assembly facility in 6 months, locating them close to where the customer demand is. They state that they could have “hundreds” of these facilities producing ""10s"" of platforms.

While this appears to be a very good idea for producing low volume vehicles and saving on transit costs, I have some concerns. Firstly, this seems like a supply chain nightmare. It’s difficult enough getting all the parts required into a single high volume car plant from all over the world in a cost effective way. But sending small amounts of parts from all over the world to hundreds of places, all over the world? That's not a task I'd fancy doing. It makes some sense to put together old-school KD kits in a central location to get around this problem.

Secondly, there is a startling lack of releases or meaningful updates about a working facility. The two which have been started for a while are over on both cost and time, with additional comments and implications that they’re struggling with it. “Production is difficult” as the company president said.

Yet they still make comments about wanting hundreds of these facilities, with 34 more planned by 2024. It would be extremely concerning if they start spending cash reserves on new facilities before they can demonstrably prove that the concept works as intended. As cheap as the microfactory concept is, it's likely still the biggest single capex on their books, and as few as 5 over the next 12 months would do major damage to their capital reserves if there is any sort of delay generating good revenue.

**Conclusion:** The microfactory model isn’t just a “nice to have”. It’s something which absolutely *has* to work for the company to succeed before they commit to more of them. In the short term, providing the vehicles are engineered and the supply chain set-up, they could at least turn to contract manufacturing if they have to, but this would significantly damage (my) confidence in the business.

**Financial**

Raised $660m by the SPAC on 24th March 2021

Cash on hand end Q1 (30th March): $516M

Cash on hand end Q2 (30th June): $445M

Cash on hand end Q3 (30th Sept): $380M

A subsequent bond and share offering was announced in the days following the Q3 report. This generated:

Green bonds: $200m

32.3m follow-on shares @ $9.50ea: $293m after expenses.

Best guess forecast for the Q4 report is cash on hand of $750m if no additional microfactory is started. Income from finance may substantially offset this.

**The Loan and an open question**

This is an open question because **I REALLY DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS SHIT WORKS**. **Don’t take it as bad. Take it as my perpetually hungover brain being too smooth. Everything here could be entirely wrong or misleading. Don’t make any decisions based on this. You have been warned!**

On 14th May 2021 the owner of the company (and majority shareholder holding about 72% of the shares) announced that a $1.5bn loan had been arranged with Citibank, via Kinetik Finance, secured against 75.7m of the owner’s Arrival shares. Of those 75.7m shares, 35.5m shares appear to have been transferred to Citibank as collateral with the remaining shares being held by Kinetik to be transferred on demand. This appears to give a strike price on the loan of $19.8 per share (which was about the share price in May 2021)

In May 2021 the mkt cap was in the range of $11.5bn, making the loan around 13% of the business. However, the mkt cap is now around $4.8bn, meaning that the loan is now 31.2% of the business. Further to that, the loan documentation appears to say that although shares were put up as collateral, Citibank can have access to all of the company’s cash and assets as well. So how does this work for Citibank now? Even if they called in all of the 75.7m pledge shares that would still only give them less than $600m at the current share price - not to mention that daily trade volumes are only around 1.5m shares. How long are they likely to wait for before they call it in? Or is there another mechanism by which they can happily accept the current share price? Maybe the loan hasn’t been fully drawn down or the facility limited / closed?

**Summary**

$ARVL is attempting to gain value by a unique, highly automated, micro factory production model with a capacity of 10,000 units per microfactory.  Although there is scant evidence that it’s close to being ready (and a lot more evidence that it’s behind schedule and over cost), if the low-cost and low capex production system works then it will set $ARVL up with a potentially highly profitable business.  It wouldn't be outside the realms of reality for it to take a lot more time for the production system to work effectively, however, the Bus may well be easily assembled by hand, giving a source of revenue. The Van products would likely be more heavily affected by a lack of automation (a bus is large, but will have proportionately less parts on it for its size compared to a van, and therefore you can have more people working on assembling it)

They’ve gone for a lot of vertical integration in their parts without stating which parts they are designing, which although gives greater flexibility on design and better control over costs, it also forces all liability onto them as well.  With no history of vehicles on the road, this could be seen as a cost risk once vehicles are in-market. Unique technology includes an impressive, in house, carbon composite used for body panels.

Vehicles are designed to not need body stamping, welding and paint facilities which reduces CAPEX requirements for production facilities. Without body stamping it will remove a normally very high cost burden in vehicle design as well.

Even with 2,400 employees, 4 vehicles is a lot to be working on simultaneously, and while trying to establish 4 micro factories and designing homegrown components, any delays in generating revenue are likely to strain cash reserves, despite what was generated through the SPAC process and subsequent bonds and follow-on share offerings.

The Q4 report is going to be critical.  Revenue targets for 2023 given during the SPAC process were withdrawn in the Q3 report. If it doesn’t have A LOT of good news and revenue targets for 2023 then the share price is likely to take a hit, especially since ***they aim to be at full production capacity in Q1 2023*** \- in 12 months time.

## Next $ARVL Report: Q4 results, approx Mid Feb 2022

Must Have:

* Positive news about a working microfactory, with a definitive **date for finishing commissioning** and **preferably** the **percentage of build automation that they are able to achieve**
* Confirmation of a start date for the First Group bus trial.
* Reintroduction of sales volume and revenue estimates for 2023

Hope for:

* An update on progress of the Bus proving ground trials, with numbers to support the information
* No further microfactory announcements without confirmation that the first two are operational and effective.

The two which have been started for a while are over on both cost and time, with additional comments and implications that they’re struggling with it.  “Production is difficult” as the company president said.

Yet they still make comments about wanting hundreds of these facilities, with 34 more planned by 2024.  It would be extremely concerning if they start spending cash reserves on new facilities before they can demonstrably prove that the concept works as intended. As cheap as the microfactory concept is, it's likely still the biggest single capex on their books, and as few as 5 over the next 12 months would do major damage to their capital reserves if there is any sort of delay generating good revenue.

**Conclusion:**  The microfactory model isn’t just a “nice to have”. It’s something which absolutely *has* to work for the company to succeed before they commit to more of them. In the short term, providing the vehicles are engineered and the supply chain set-up, they could at least turn to contract manufacturing if they have to, but this would significantly damage (my) confidence in the business.

**Financial**

Raised $660m by the SPAC on 24th March 2021

Cash on hand end Q1 (30th March): $516M

Cash on hand end Q2 (30th June): $445M

Cash on hand end Q3 (30th Sept): $380M

A subsequent bond and share offering was announced in the days following the Q3 report. This generated:

Green bonds: $200m

32.3m follow-on shares @ $9.50ea: $293m after expenses.

Best guess forecast for the Q4 report is cash on hand of $750m if no additional microfactory is started.  Income from finance may substantially offset this.

**The Loan and an open question**

This is an open question because **I REALLY DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS SHIT WORKS**. **Don’t take it as bad.  Take it as my perpetually hungover brain being too smooth. Everything here could be entirely wrong or misleading.  Don’t make any decisions based on this. You have been warned!**

On 14th May 2021 the owner of the company (and majority shareholder holding about 72% of the shares) announced that a $1.5bn loan had been arranged with Citibank, via Kinetik Finance, secured against 75.7m of the owner’s Arrival shares. Of those 75.7m shares, 35.5m shares appear to have been transferred to Citibank as collateral with the remaining shares being held by Kinetik to be transferred on demand. This appears to give a strike price on the loan of $19.8 per share (which was about the share price in May 2021)

In May 2021 the mkt cap was in the range of $11.5bn, making the loan around 13% of the business.  However, the mkt cap is now around $4.8bn, meaning that the loan is now 31.2% of the business. Further to that, the loan documentation appears to say that although shares were put up as collateral, Citibank can have access to all of the company’s cash and assets as well.  So how does this work for Citibank now?  Even if they called in all of the 75.7m pledge shares that would still only give them less than $600m at the current share price - not to mention that daily trade volumes are only around 1.5m shares. How long are they likely to wait for before they call it in? Or is there another mechanism by which they can happily accept the current share price? Maybe the loan hasn’t been fully drawn down or the facility limited / closed?

Obviously the Ark funds (or any actively managed funds) are risky. Over a 15-year period only 13% of active funds outperform the market (however, 54% of active 'emerging market' funds outperform the market so maybe it's not as risky as most active funds) and of course we all see how poorly Ark did in 2021 while the market did great. But what do y'all think about its long term prospects? A lot of the holdings are small cap innovative tech companies that are in their early stages and aren't profitable yet. Artificial intelligence and robotics are the future. Some of these early stage innovators could be future Amazons. Amazon made revenue and no profit for a long time because of high operating costs in early years, and then profits soared. Might we not see the same with artificial intelligence?

9634,wallstreetbets,ATER - Why am I still bullish and why any price below $4.50 is a great entry point?,"ATER suffered financially due to their debt and lower than anticipated cash as they needed to use their cash to pay exorbitant export fees which are now 4 to 5 times lower than what they used to be in Q2'2021. Aterian told its investors in Nov 2021 that Amazon’s ocean freight service helped it “secure very competitive shipping rates” for products that are expected to generate half of its expected sales in the next year.

Amazon and merchants like Aterian have a shared goal: Making sure that there are enough products on virtual shelves for us to buy. Amazon has the money and the heft to arm-twist ocean cargo companies so its merchants can send their products at an affordable price. Aterian is benefiting from this, and they have sorted their debt - check the Annual Net Operating Cash Flow from the below: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ATER/financials

I'm personally very bullish with ATER and have high expectations in terms of EPS Q4'2021 in March (next ER).

Omicron seems to be less critical than previous covid strains so current risk outlook for economic destabilisation is lower than it was before. Less likely to affect fees, warehousing and product logistics.

What makes you doubt a positive outlook? It's current stock performance makes you doubt whether this play is a good one? I don't blame you for that, that's what the HF wants us to feel - shorts are beating the crap out of that stock, despite big whales buying small to medium batches of shares.

Many investors have become bag holder back in September, as HFs managed to kill the squeeze opportunity by stopping the run up from $3 to $18 by short ladder attacks, increase of short position, negative media coverage and of course darkpool shorts (which are being investigated by SEC after Yaniv (ATER CEO) funded an investigation via a third party legal firm (still ongoing).

$3.60 is the bottom (historically) and it was All Time Low when the outlook for ATER was a lot less promising. So current price (below $4.50) is a great entry point.

ATER is a growth stock and also a potential squeeze play.

9637,wallstreetbets,How to invest in Space-X pre-IPO or any stock pre-ipo without crazy minimums.,"I see people constantly wanting in on the Elon Musk cult of companies. Mainly SpaceX, due to large potential growth, and cult following. A lot of people think you can not buy shares in SpaceX (Company I will focus on) But you can, and you can also buy other Pre-IPO shares of hundreds of companies like Kraken, Triller etc..  do this at your own risk.
First: Have a lot of money, stop right here if you don't make 200k individually or 1 million in net worth. Sorry your SOL, make some tendies then come back.


Second How to buy these shares: It's unlikely that you can go directly to companies unless you got a private broker and are really rich. But luckily some smart people realized that somewhat rich folk want in. I will talk about Access2preIPO. They do not require crazy minimums like Forge or Equityzen.
There minimums are 25k across the board. 
For SpaceX with having endless rounds of funding, the shares are pretty liquid. And if they ever IPO you will be a rich man. Please check out their FAQ, and do your DD.


Third: Relating to SpaceX they are probably my 1#, they inked an army deal for StarLink, and are by far the best positioned for Space Transport cost. Could be a trillionaire dollar company if StarLink does as promised. Not even mixing in a Mars colony. To quote one engineer, “ Elon tells us what to make”.
TLDR: Have 1 million dollars or 200k in income. Make an account with Access2preIPO submit an offer, buy shares. This is not financial advice, contact your tax person to make sure you meet all requirements and potential tax bills.

I mostly lurk but I've been here since y'all were in middle school. See my BWLD post below.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6m2vfe/4k\_in\_long\_august\_puts\_for\_bwld/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6m2vfe/4k_in_long_august_puts_for_bwld/)

And here is my post last year regarding GoEasy.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0557h/dd\_goeasy\_to\_the\_fucking\_moon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0557h/dd_goeasy_to_the_fucking_moon/)

My BWLD trade recommendation made 40% in 1 month from when I recommended it to when I closed the position.

My GoEasy trade is up 74% (including dividends) in the past 11 months from when I recommended it. I am still holding GoEasy.

Those are the only two recommendations I have made.

AutoNation will be my third.

In the spirit of the holiday season and seeing how you retards can't even beat the S&amp;P500 (lmao), I've decided to make a charitable contribution to you all and share my next position: AutoNation.

AutoNation is America's largest retailer of new cars and has all the top legacy brands (Toyota, Ford, GM, Stellantis, Mercedez, Honda, etc.) in its New Car Dealership portfolio.

Due to the chip shortage, the prices of both used cars and new cars are up substantially. AutoNation's gross profit per New Vehicle is up 116% while their New retail units are down by 12% (!). They have run down their inventory from over 50 days worth of sales to now under 10 days. You can see this if you drive by any Car Dealership in the US. Despite this drop in units sold, AutoNation has hit record revenues this past year.

Catalyst 1: With the chip shortage abating, prices being sticky, and huge pent-up demand for personal automotive (who wants to sit on a bus or train with Covid?) we should see higher supply of cars and more units sold in 2022 at higher pricing. I expect record revenue again in 2022.

Autonation has also worked to reduce Selling, General, and Admin cost as a percentage of gross profit. They hit record low Selling, General, and Admin costs in both the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2021 and that has lead to 6 consecutive quarters of all-time record earnings.

With the new paradigm of tighter supply-demand in the automotive sector, the dealerships do not have to pay as much incentives to sales staff as the sales are much easier. Combined with the huge pent-up demand, this is catalyst 2.

Catalyst 2: Selling, General, and Admin Cost discipline has lead to 6 consecutive record quarters. With the new supply-demand environment, EPS should be supported at new higher level moving forward.

Catalyst 3: Buybacks. I love when a company buys back shares. This company is among the best at it. They reduced their shares outstanding 20% this year and they continue to increase the authorized buyback amount. This should support 20% higher EPS moving forward. The majority of the buyback was funded from Cash Flow from Operations and Cash on Hand.

Catalyst 4: They have acquired 2 companies this year worth an additional 4% in Revenue (and Earnings). Combined with Catalyst 3, this should boost earnings 24%+ moving forward.

Catalyst 5: Mike Manley is taking over as CEO. The guy who turned Jeep around and boosted sales over 100% is the new CEO. He left being the head of North American Operations of Stellantis to become the CEO of AutoNation. I think the market is undervaluing the transformation that we could see at AutoNation in the next few years.

Catalyst 6: Used Car sales. Under the AutoNation Brand, the company is planning to open 130 Used Car locations called AutoNation USA by 2026. As the used car market is 3x the sales of the New Car Market in the US and with such a strong brand, I anticipate them to be able to boost EPS quickly with each new store.

Catalyst 7: P/E Expansion. AutoNation currently trades at a 8 trailing P/E and a 6.5 forward P/E. For an overall market that is trading a historic highs, this is an anomaly.

Other used car dealers (CarMax has a P/E of 18) have higher P/E multiples as the used car market is more resilient to shocks (the used cars are already produced - don't need to worry about supply chain issues or chip shortages etc.)

If AutoNation can get a blended P/E of 12 with the introduction of Catalyst 6, it would support a share price that is almost double what it is now. Combined with the Catalyst 3 and 4, we could see EPS of $25/share in 2022. Multiplying by current P/E Ratio, that is $200 per share (71% increase). Multiplying by P/E Ratio of 12, that is $300 per share (156% increase)

Position Disclosure: I have 2,000 shares of AutoNation.",1641073304

9698,wallstreetbets,DD - Annual Gift for you Autists - AutoNation,"I've decided to make a once annual recommendation to you autists. 

I mostly lurk but I've been here since y'all were in middle school. See my BWLD post below.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6m2vfe/4k\_in\_long\_august\_puts\_for\_bwld/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6m2vfe/4k_in_long_august_puts_for_bwld/)

And here is my post last year regarding GoEasy.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0557h/dd\_goeasy\_to\_the\_fucking\_moon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0557h/dd_goeasy_to_the_fucking_moon/)

My BWLD trade recommendation made 40% in 1 month from when I recommended it to when I closed the position.

My GoEasy trade is up 74% (including dividends) in the past 11 months from when I recommended it. I am still holding GoEasy.

Those are the only two recommendations I have made. 

AutoNation will be my third.

In the spirit of the holiday season and seeing how you retards can't even beat the S&amp;P500 (lmao), I've decided to make a charitable contribution to you all and share my next position: AutoNation.

AutoNation is America's largest retailer of new cars and has all the top legacy brands (Toyota, Ford, GM, Stellantis, Mercedez, Honda, etc.) in its New Car Dealership portfolio.

Due to the chip shortage, the prices of both used cars and new cars are up substantially. AutoNation's gross profit per New Vehicle is up 116% while their New retail units are down by 12% (!). They have run down their inventory from over 50 days worth of sales to now under 10 days. You can see this if you drive by any Car Dealership in the US. Despite this drop in units sold, AutoNation has hit record revenues this past year.

Catalyst 1: With the chip shortage abating, prices being sticky, and huge pent-up demand for personal automotive (who wants to sit on a bus or train with Covid?) we should see higher supply of cars and more units sold in 2022 at higher pricing. I expect record revenue again in 2022.

Autonation has also worked to reduce SG&amp;A cost as a percentage of gross profit. They hit record low SG&amp;A costs in both the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2021 and that has lead to 6 consecutive quarters of all-time record earnings.

With the new paradigm of tighter supply-demand in the automotive sector, the dealerships do not have to pay as much incentives to sales staff as the sales are much easier. Combined with the huge pent-up demand, this is catalyst 2.

Catalyst 2: SG&amp;A discipline has lead to 6 consecutive record quarters. With the new supply-demand environment, EPS should be supported at new higher level moving forward.

Catalyst 3: Buybacks. I love when a company buys back shares. This company is among the best at it. They reduced their shares outstanding 20% this year and they continue to increase the authorized buyback amount. This should support 20% higher EPS moving forward. The majority of the buyback was funded from Cash Flow from Operations and Cash on Hand.

Catalyst 4: They have acquired 2 companies this year worth an additional 4% in Revenue (and Earnings). Combined with Catalyst 3, this should boost earnings 24%+  moving forward.

Catalyst 5: Mike Manley is taking over as CEO. The guy who turned Jeep around and boosted sales over 100% is the new CEO. He left being the head of North American Operations of Stellantis to become the CEO of AutoNation. I think the market is undervaluing the transformation that we could see at AutoNation in the next few years.

Catalyst 6: Used Car sales. Under the AutoNation Brand, the company is planning to open 130 Used Car locations called AutoNation USA by 2026. As the used car market is 3x the sales of the New Car Market in the US and with such a strong brand, I anticipate them to be able to boost EPS quickly with each new store.

If you did well enough to owe taxes there's only a couple of knobs left to twist to prepare for April.

There is the 4th quarter payment which is due by January 18th, 2022. Ideally you can have it set up so that you'll owe, but you'll owe less than 1,000. Which is where I think the government starts getting upset because you owe too much.

Finally there is the deposit to a traditional IRA which can act as an income tax deduction if you discover that you're still owing too much. You've got until April 15, 2022 to make your deposits for 2021 if you need to utilize that as an avenue to getting your taxes down. Assuming you've earned enough to do so and you didn't hit your limit.

I gathered all the DD on the variety of different loans being forced into the market by financial institutions just to be bundled into collateral to be traded in with the banks for 10x leverage and reinvested to inflate the markets.🤓 I'm hoping this fun but educational approach would make it easy for the average person to digest this information.

9858,wallstreetbets,Cashback with SocialGood,"SocialGood is an app that offers cashback and rewards paid in their native token ""Social Good"" (SG). The token is traded at exchanges like Bittrex and Bitmart and can be cashed out for free.

It is one of those ""sounds too good to be true..."" types... that actually works. And pays out.

**What can you get with my Referral**

- $200 sign up reward paid in SG, this shows up immediately, but will be pending until you make a purchase, worth at least $30 within 30 days of signing up

- 100% cashback at aliexpress; 50% at ebay; 50% Booking.com and various other retailers

**Suggestion:**

Only buy something that you need/can use... and then wait to enjoy the cashback and sign up bonus.

----
**STEPS**

1. Click/tap [to follow this link to sign up]
https://referral.socialgood.inc/?id=CJZNLT
, it should take you to the app download and when you register, the code will autofill. If it doesn't, manually type it in: **CJZNLT**  
NO KCY needed for the app!

2. You'll immediately see $200 worth of SG pending

3. To unlock, just ensure you buy something worth at least $30 

4. The transaction may take several days to track, but will eventually show up (7 days on average for me) on the buying history

5. The tokens will move from pending to fully credited and withdrawable (for free) usually around 30 days (sometimes more) after the date of the purchase

So to recap: just use the app as you would with any cashback site. Buy something you need/use. Then it's just a matter of waiting, first for it to track in app and then tokens to unlock --- when the tokens are fully credited, you can simply withdraw and trade them.",1641051767

9863,wallstreetbets,AMRN: Current valuation makes this a 2022 asymmetric risk opportunity in biotech with near term catalysts,"
Not investing advice. All thoughts expressed here should be vetted before investing. Always do your own due diligence.

2021 was a brutal year for AMRN after a brutal 2020 before that. The company has failed to execute on the rollout of its groundbreaking cardio drug Vascepa, and rightfully the stock has been a total disaster dumpster fire. The stock hit new lows for good reasons. 

But This post is not going to cry over spilled milk or rehash how we got here. Long story short Judge Du of Nevada destroyed AMRNs shot at greatness and everything went tits up from there. But today we have a stock at $3.40ish implying a $1.3bn market cap versus a total annual revenue opportunity of $1bn near term assuming management does not fuck things up even more (YTD revenues are already at $440mm). Longer term Vascepa once launched globally could be $2bn drug annually but that is 3+ years from Now. 

As investors what is important today is not to dwell on the past but focus on the future. Here is what we should expect in 1H2022:

1) Some signs of growth in US sales confirming that the new sales / marketing plan is paying dividends. Reality is that at $440mm in US YTD sales is proof that AMRNs commercialization strategy for its cardio risk reduction indication has been a massive fail. Given how groundbreaking REDUCE-IT was when the data was released in 2019 it is amazing how poorly AMRN failed to capitalize on the medical community goodwill. Its too easy to blame the generics (which muddied the new indication launch) but they are not the sole source of the revenue malaise. 

2) Initial traction in Germany post the recent launch. Biggest market in EU. The problem is going to be Covid and investors are right to be skeptical but that is priced in. Any signs that German doctors are adopting EPA into treatment regimen will be early traction in realizing the broader EU opportunity. Long term AMRN thinks EU total is $1bn in annual revenues; short term Germany plus other european markets should hopefully contribute to getting AMRN to its 2022 sales target. 

3) China approval. Another big market. Approval was supposed to come before year end but never did. It is possible that AMRN is waiting to announce the news at the JPM Healthcare Conference which is a preferred venue for many big announcements. Hard to say how quickly China is going to start producing revenues but it will certainly help the company get to its 2022 sales targets. 

4) Shareholder activism. This is the wild card and the biggest potential opportunity for the stock. Sarissa is run by an ex Icahn executive who has successfully agitated for sales of biotechs to large pharmas in the past and understands how to orchestrate a same. The firm recently took a stake in AMRN and has been silent so far. Its just a matter of time before we learn about the fund’s exact intentions but given how far AMRN stock has fallen and given how unsuccessful this company has been in monetizing its amazing drug there can be no doubt that a sale to a pharma partner has to rank right at the top of the activist agenda. Unfortunately AMRNs management team is a group of self interested individuals who just want to clip a paycheck but this company has no business being independent. 

Long story short. There seems to be little downside at current valuations while the news above could easily cause a rerating. At $1.3bn market cap this company is trading at roughly 1x sales with an approved drug in US and EU. Regulatory risk is literally zero as is clinical trial risk since all the data is already done and only keeps getting better. Simple fact is that EPA is one of the biggest cardio breakthroughs since statins were invented in the 80s and the drug has the ability to affect millions of patients given prevalence of cardiovascular disease. AMRNs failure has nothing to do with its drug but with its inability or capitalize on the commercial opportunity in front of the company.",1641050940

At $1.3bn market cap this company is trading at roughly 1x sales with an approved drug in US and EU. Regulatory risk is literally zero as is clinical trial risk since all the data is already done and only keeps getting better. Simple fact is that EPA is one of the biggest cardio breakthroughs since statins were invented in the 80s and the drug has the ability to affect millions of patients given prevalence of cardiovascular disease. AMRNs failure has nothing to do with its drug but with its inability or capitalize on the commercial opportunity in front of the company.",1641050038

9880,wallstreetbets,Why Dry Bulk Shipping is going to be a big winner in 2022/2023. The sector is entering a multi-year super cycle.,"Hi everybody, happy New Year. This is my first ever DD so hopefully I can convey my points, and why my account is 100% invested in dry bulk stocks. I posted this a couple weeks ago, but wanted to rewrite it to fix some things.

&amp;#x200B;

First, what is dry bulk shipping? Dry bulk shipping is the movement of commodities in bulk on ships. Coal, iron, grain, etc. are all popular commodities carried on these ships. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI), is an index that tracks the cost of transporting these commodities. When the BDI is high, it means that dry bulk shippers are making lots of money because they are benefitting from the rise in transport costs.

&amp;#x200B;

Historic levels of the Baltic Dry Index:

The BDI peaked in May of 2008, hitting 11440. It soon collapsed afterwards due to the global recession and reduced demand for shipping. For the last decade, the BDI has been trading in a tight range from roughly 750-1500. However, in 2021 the BDI rallied hard as economies recovered from COVID-19 along with increased demand from countries other than China, hitting a peak of 5650 in October 2021. The BDI is currently at 2217, down from its peak in October due to China cutting steel production for the Winter Olympics.

&amp;#x200B;

[Baltic Dry Index \(BDI\)](https://preview.redd.it/1xd2y7o123981.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fe82d16c6b87fd99ac389cd0583f8e0e7606171)

One thing that many may be wondering is if the high rates we're seeing now are sustainable. I believe not only that they are, but that they will continue to go higher, even further than the peak we saw in October 2021. I'll explain my reasons why demand is looking very healthy for the next few years, and will continue to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

In past years the BDI has largely been driven by China, and China only. This has changed in 2021, with a large portion of demand coming from countries such as Brazil and India. In fact, China has been slacking in demand this year due to strict COVID-19 restrictions, along with steel production limits so that they can have clear skies for the Winter Olympics. The limits will be lifted shortly after the Olympics, but what's important is that the BDI is maintaining decade high levels without China. When China reenters the picture sometime in March 2022, it could be the tipping point where demand outpaces supply.

&amp;#x200B;

From Star Bulk Carriers Q3 2021 Earnings Transcript:

""And China basically wanted clear skies for the Olympic games. So it's a combination of clear skies and reduction of commodity prices from China. That's what their goal was. But let me make a side point here which I think is important. I was going through the imports of China earlier today and I realized that in the last 10 months of 2021, China actually imported 2 million tons less than last year. And you remember what we all used to say that if China sneezes, we will catch pneumonia -- the market will catch pneumonia. Well, China sneezed and we didn't catch exactly pneumonia. So I think that happened because the rest of the world came up."" -  Petros Pappas, CEO of Star Bulk Carriers answer when asked why rates are down from the October peak.

""This market that we've seen during 2021 has been without China being in the picture. And that in our view means that once China re-enters at some point next year, it will sow a much stronger market."" - Petros Pappas, final closing thoughts on the earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

I highly recommend reading the entire transcript, but these two quotes support my points above. The next thing I want to talk about is the supply situation, and the reasons why there will be very little fleet growth for the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

First, the shipping industry has been depressed for over a decade. The last time we saw a bull run in 2008, companies purchased a ton of vessels (which they later scrapped for metal), and then when the BDI collapsed, were stuck with useless vessels because there was no demand for them. It's highly unlikely that any company is going to want to take on the risk of substantially growing their fleet after what happened last time.

Secondly, even if companies do want to grow their fleet, it will be very hard too. This is because shipbuilding capacity is down hard since 2008, and there isn't the space to build these ships.

&amp;#x200B;

[Orderbook for new vessels](https://preview.redd.it/0e9nd0sd23981.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871dfbff694e855f622486a091a7b6d7ea028fe3)

In the last bull run, on average only 50 vessels were being delivered per year. If you look at today,  it's roughly the same, with future years sharing the same average. What's happening is there simply isn't enough space in the shipyards to build these vessels in mass quantity, and there won't be for quite a few years.

With 2022 and 2023 showing reluctance to take on new vessel orders, it's expected that capesize growth will only grow by 2.8%, and 1.6% overall for these two years. In short, not much is being added to the supply side for the next two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've discussed the supply / demand side of things, and why it's looking quite favorable, I want to point out the actual companies.

Pretty much all dry bulk shippers follow the same chart pattern, and all are fair game, but I chose to go with Star Bulk Carriers ($SBLK).

&amp;#x200B;

[$SBLK -1 year view, 155&amp;#37; return](https://preview.redd.it/7p9ang0443981.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08c630148e295c215b91a38202d6075dd5d17a69)

The stock pays a massive 22% annual dividend yield (although I don't expect the yield to stay this high as the stock will rise). I know you're probably thinking there is no way this is sustainable, but the good news is that Star Bulk has a dividend policy based on their cash flow.

&amp;#x200B;

The company is extremely undervalued also, even after 155% YTD returns. Analysts have price targets averaging $35, and it's currently been trading in a range from $18-$24 for the last 8 months.

P/E Ratio: 4.21

EPS: $2.19

&amp;#x200B;

[Earnings growth for the past year](https://preview.redd.it/pqrhs76253981.png?width=517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b7047a23aa8bcda9023de28577152f8fa5f6acd)

The company is very well managed, and is set to grow even if the BDI does not rally to record highs. Combining the dividends, and the favorable supply/demand situation, $SBLK is a value investors dream.

I think both shares and options can work well with this stock, you just have to pick which way you want to play it. It's a pretty safe play to buy the stock, collect dividends, and sell covered calls. On the other hand, I expect enough growth that LEAPs will generate high returns.

&amp;#x200B;

My positions:

$SBLK Jan 2024 $25 calls (Yes, I know the spread is autistic but I'm holding until expiration. And yes, I know dividends will be working against me, I'm just really bullish)

&amp;#x200B;

Closing thoughts:

I am very bullish on the dry bulk sector for the next 2 years. The low vessel growth, combined with an increased demand for commodities will result in a favorable supply/demand situation, and dry bulk equities will be making record profits. This isn't a sector much discussed on Reddit, but that's not a bad thing. You won't get rich overnight with this sector, but if you want to hold for a few years it will most likely pay off.",1641047236

9897,wallstreetbets,Investing in Israel,"I have been studying companies based in Israel for some time now.  I guess my first exposure was when $TEVA hit my screens.  Since then, I've been looking for opportunities in Israel to fill my international allocation.

By the way, if you want to use a mutual fund or ETF to do the work for you, here are some choices  [Top 0 Israel Funds and ETFs in 2021 - MutualFunds.com - MutualFunds.com](https://mutualfunds.com/geography-categories/israel-funds-and-etfs/) 

First, the International Monetary Fund looks for Israel's economy to grow 5% in 2022. That is a robust estimate.  That makes this country with a democratic government an attractive growth prospect.

Based on rolling averages, a core investment approach in Israel would have yielded a return of 21%.  This is far better than the international index of 7% and beats the index 82% of the time.

My approach is to look for attractive targets that are financially healthy (Altman-Z &gt; 3) and appear to be undervalued compared to their historical growth and valuations.  It also helps that the company has a positive free cash flow.  I look at revenues, earnings, and free cash flow; literally, top to bottom.

Here are my growth stocks:

* Magal Security ($SNT)
* Sapiens International ($SPNS)
* Ituran Location and Control ($ITRN)
* Audiocodes ($AUDC)
* G Willi-Food International ($WILC)
* Radware ($RDWR)
* Camtek ($CAMT)
* Check Point Software ($CHKP)

Here are some companies that don't have an earnings history that can be evaluated, but do have sales growth, and positive free cash flow.

* Mind Cti ($MNDO)
* Silicom ($SILC)
* RADA Electronic Industries ($RADA)

9930,wallstreetbets,Behold the 3rd largest automaker!," Rivian (RIVN) is a corporation damned to bankruptcy because it missed the boat on the electric vehicle adoption curve. This is because in the normal 2023 and early 2024 model years most traditional automakers will: have figured out how to make EV’s, and more importantly produce them at scale.

The bull case for disruptive tech companies in general is that they can build market share and profit margins based on that market share and product lock in. The problem is that the global auto industry is figuring out battery electric vehicles. This means that the future profit streams are going to be subject to the meat grinder called the global auto industry (one of the most competitive industries on earth)!

If battery electric vehicles are not successful due to the fundamental constraints of the technology, traditional auto makers have the legacy products continuing to make money and can sell electric vehicles as a niche product to improve cafe ratings!

But even more importantly; Rivian unlike Tesla (TSLA) does not have the time to develop their production capabilities, without normal automakers catching up on battery electric vehicle technology! So even if battery electric vehicles are the future: the fact is, that Rivian does not have the physical capital and know how to produce vehicles at scale. Tesla was inches away from bankruptcy, when Tesla was figuring out how to produce the Model 3! How much more so will Rivian be, when other auto manufacturers release their competing battery electric vehicles, (for example Honda’s (HMC) release of the Honda Prologue, which is most likely to be about the size of the Honda Pilot, or Acura MDX; or more importantly the Rivian R1S! And of course, Honda can produce a Ridgeline version of the Prologue to compete against the R1T.)

Unfortunately, Rivian has missed the boat. Have fun watching the stock return to her actual value! Or you can head my warning and sell now for a great profit.

9937,wallstreetbets,Lets become Astronauts,Happy New Year every one!!! GameStop stock surge was a prime example of what can happen when a dedicated group on individuals unite and reach for the stars!! The same can be done with small cap coins in tbe crypt markets. Take Holo (HOT) for example the ROI since it came on the scene in in 2018 is over 1100% going from bottom of the barrel to a top 100 and right now its only $0.00948 cad with a market cap of 1.61 billion with about 173 Billion circulating. The highest it's reached was 0.0399 and its predicted that by 2030 it will be at $5.00 do the math....another is Chiliz (CHZ) same thing and these aren't M E M E coins they actually have a purpose behind them.

9978,wallstreetbets,Happy New Year - My gift to you: a theory for real-time tracking of Pelosi trades.,"I was reading that Pelosi post after an edible and I got this idea how to see her trades in real-time:

Step 1:  INVESTIGATE.  Look at trade history.  Past behavior predicts future behavior.  Look at the purchase date to anything historic, ie passing a bill, eoq, market cap, sector, frequency of each ticker, etc.

Step 2:  Get a subscription to a service that will alert you if there is a large number of option purchased and then build queries based on your data from step 1.

Step 3:  Test it out for accuracy.

Step 4:  Start trading.",1641008873
