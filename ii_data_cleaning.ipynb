       "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 16th, 2021-\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# [Dow futures up 200 points following Fed decision to aggressively wind down asset purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)\\n\\n*****\\n&gt; U.S. stock futures rose sharply in early Thursday trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.\\n*****\\n&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 222 points. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.7% each.\\n*****\\n&gt; Shares of companies that have done well in previous rate-hiking cycles led premarket gainers. Materials stocks FMC Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan both rose more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. Bank stocks also rose across the board, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all up about 0.6%.\\n*****\\n&gt; In transportation news, Delta Air Lines reported that it now expects to see a profit of $200 million in the fourth quarter, after previously projecting a loss. Shares rose 2.2% on the news.\\n*****\\n&gt; In other central banking news, the Bank of England announced it is hiking its key policy rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. Markets were awaiting a separate policy decision from the European Central Bank. There also is more economic news on tap, with weekly jobless claims and housing starts out at 8:30 a.m. ET.\\n*****\\n&gt; Following the Fed news, traders accelerated their own expectations for interest rate increases. Fed funds futures trading now points to a 63% chance of the first quarter-percentage-point increase coming in May 2022, with chances also rising to about 44% that the central bank could make its first move as soon as March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\\n*****\\n&gt; Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.\\n*****\\n&gt; ‚ÄúThe fact that the FOMC acknowledged new COVID variants as a threat to the economic recovery that could alter policy going forward, as well as the generally optimistic tone from Powell in the presser, helped spark a relief rally as the Fed meeting was viewed as being not-as-hawkish-as-feared,‚Äù Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report said in a note on Thursday.\\n*****\\n&gt; The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December. That decision follows recent inflation data showing a 6.8% surge in November, which is higher than expected and the fastest rate since 1982.\\n*****\\n&gt; ‚ÄúThe notion that elevated inflation levels would be transitory has finally been thrown out the window by the Fed and the latest policy adjustments are reflective of a committee that doesn‚Äôt want to miss the next train leaving the station,‚Äù said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.\\n*****\\n&gt; Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.\\n*****\\n&gt; Adobe and Accenture are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell. FedEx and Rivian will report after the bell.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/REVymQM.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GXTQVZd.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2JZE6Tm.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/PLqYFDi.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/iF0hbEZ.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/FwXIQ6E.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/jciUpQX.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aqK6Q30.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lon23ob.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/gpKr8gV.png)**)\\n\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/c3XQXzc.png)**)\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/spOJUGV.png)**)\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GOC2O9N.png)**)\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/N4MNSXg.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/14iGGYL.png)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]()**)\\n(N/A.)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\\n\\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-delta-air-lines-accenture-regeneron-and-others.html)**)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n&gt; **Delta Air Lines (DAL)** ‚Äì Delta rose 2.3% in the premarket after projecting a $200 million fourth-quarter profit.
